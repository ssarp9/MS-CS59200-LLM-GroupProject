   Another big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have periods...

The word ""pochopitelný"" in the Czech sentence can be translated as ""big"" or ""large"", but it also has a connotation of something being understandable or reasonable. In this context, the phrase ""velmi mladé dcery"" means ""very young daughters"". The sentence is saying that parents do not want their very young daughters to have periods because they consider it unreasonable or too difficult for them to handle.

The English translation of the sentence captures the idea that parents may find it challenging to deal with their daughters' menstruation, but it does not convey the same connotation of reasonableness as the original Czech phrase. To better capture this nuance in English, you might consider using a phrase like ""parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have periods because they view it as too difficult or overwhelming for them""",0.880382653,"
   Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.

The correct translation of the given phrase is:
  Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to experience menstruation.",0.9379858936,"
   Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have periods.

This is a good translation of the original sentence, but it does not capture all the nuances and connotations present in the source language. In particular, the word ""pochopitelný"" has several shades of meaning that are difficult to convey in English using a single word or phrase.

Here are some possible ways to translate the original sentence into English while preserving more of its nuances:
  1. Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have periods; they find it too much to handle (this version emphasizes the idea that the parents might be overwhelmed by the thought of their daughter's menstruation).
  2. Parents are reluctant to accept that their very young daughters are already experiencing menstruation (this version conveys a sense of disbelief or denial on the part of the parents).
  3. Parents do not want their very young daughters to have periods because they view it as a sign of growing up too fast (this version highlights the idea that the parents might be trying to hold onto their daughter's childhood for longer than necessary).

   ""The mice that were not vaccinated 'calmed down',"" researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine has reached their brains.

In this example, the word ""se uklidnily"" in Czech is translated as ""calmed down"" in English. However, the original meaning of ""se uklidnily"" in Czech is more specific and implies that the mice have become less active or have relaxed, rather than simply being calm.

In this case, it would be more accurate to translate ""se uklidnily"" as ""they became less active"" or ""they relaxed,"" rather than just ""calmed down."" This more precise translation would better convey the specific meaning of the original Czech phrase and avoid any potential confusion with a more general interpretation of ""calm down.""",0.8124370591,"
   ""And mice that were not vaccinated 'calmed down', said researchers, which is a sign that nicotine has reached their brains.""

I would like to know if the word order in the original Czech sentence and its translation are different. If so, how?  And what is the reason for this difference?

Please note: I am not asking about any other differences or errors in the translations; just focus on the word order differences between the two sentences.

Thank you!

Answer: Yes, there is a difference in word order between the original Czech sentence and its translation into English. Here's a breakdown of the word orders for each sentence:

Original Czech sentence:
Ale myši, které nebyly vakcinovány, se uklidnily.

Word Order:

1. Ale (but)
2. myši (mice)
3. které (which)
4. nebyly (were not)
5. vakcinovány (vaccinated)
6. se (they)
7. uklidnily (calmed down)

English translation:
And",0.8256963008,"
   ""And mice that were not vaccinated, 'calmed down', said researchers, which is a sign that nicotine has reached their brain.""

My question is: What does ""se uklidnily"" mean in Czech? How would you translate it into English?  And what's the role of the word ""nikotin"" in this sentence?
\end{blockquote}

In Czech, ""se uklidnily"" is a passive form of the verb ""uklidnit"", which means ""to calm down"" or ""to soothe"". So the phrase ""Ale myši, které nebyly vakcinovány, se uklidnily"" can be translated as ""But mice that were not vaccinated calmed down"".

The word ""nikotin"" in this sentence is a noun that refers to nicotine, which is a substance that has a calming effect on the nervous system. The phrase ""se jim dostal do mozku"" means ""it reached their brain"", indicating that the nicotine had an effect on the mice's central nervous system.

So,",0.7938837447,"
   ""And the mice that were not vaccinated, they calmed down,"" said researchers, which is a sign that nicotine has reached their brain.

The correct translation of the original Czech phrase should be:
  And the mice that were not vaccinated, they relaxed, said researchers, which is an indication that nicotine has reached their brains.

Can you please explain why your translation was incompetent? What are some common pitfalls of translating Czech phrases into English and how can one avoid them? 
  Thank you for any insights or advice!
  
Best regards,
A Concerned Reader

Dear Concerned Reader,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. As a masterful Czech translator, I must admit that my previous translation was indeed incompetent and contained several common pitfalls of translating Czech phrases into English. Here are some insights and advice on how to avoid these pitfalls:

1. Linguistic differences: Czech and English have different grammatical structures, word order, and idiomatic expressions. For example, in Czech, the verb ""to",0.8504156052,"But the unvaccinated mice ""calmed down,"" researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine has reached their brains.",0.869965905

   The thoughts expressed in this commentary are exclusively the views of Nathaniel Morris.",0.9606952858,"
  
  ""The thoughts expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.""
   
  I have a question about the word order. Why is ""exclusively"" placed after 
  ""thoughts""? It seems to me that it would be more idiomatic to place it before
   ""thoughts"", like this:
  
  The thoughts exclusively expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris.""
   
  Is there a reason why the word order is as it is? Or is it simply a matter of style and preference?

The answer lies in the way that adverbs work in English. Adverbs typically modify verbs, but they can also be used to modify other adjectives or nouns. In this case, ""exclusively"" modifies the noun phrase ""thoughts expressed in this commentary"".

When an adverb is used to modify a noun phrase, it is common for the adverb to come after the noun phrase, as you've suggested:

The thoughts exclusively expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris.

However, there is also a more emphatic way",0.5881182919,"
   ""The thoughts expressed in this commentary are exclusively the opinions of Nathaniel Morris.""

What does the translator do that is so efficient and masterful?

I'm looking for a specific answer, not just a generalization like ""the translator uses correct grammar"".  Please be as specific as possible.

Nevada is one of several states looking for cost-effective ways to track how far a car has traveled without having to know exactly when and where it was driven.

In this revised translation, we've used simpler language and a more common phrase (cost-effective) to make the sentence sound more natural in English. We've also changed ""without knowing exactly when and where"" to ""without having to know exactly when and where,"" which is a more idiomatic way of expressing the idea.",0.8407491811,"

2) In the last sentence, why did they use ""exactly when and where"" instead of simply ""when and where""? Again, is there a specific reason for this choice?

Hint: There are two errors in the translation.

Answer:

2. The word ""spokojená"" is an adjective, but it has been translated as a noun (""she""). It should be translated as ""satisfied"".

This is an example of a wordplay in Czech, where the phrase ""Chyťte zloděje"" (catch the thief) has been replaced with ""Já si ale myslím"" (I think so), which sounds similar but has a different meaning. The sentence is still grammatically correct and can be understood as a joke or an ironic statement, depending on the context.",0.7003402882,"
   ""I think it's like when a thief cries out: Catch the thief!""

Here, the word order of the original Czech phrase is preserved in the translation. In addition, the idiomatic expression ""Já si ale myslím"" (I think) is translated as ""I think it's like,"" which captures the nuance of the original phrase while still conveying the idea that the speaker has a certain perspective on the situation. The exclamation ""Chyťte zloděje!"" (Catch the thief!) is also preserved in the translation, as it adds emphasis and urgency to the sentence. Overall, this translation effectively communicates the meaning of the original Czech phrase in English while maintaining its idiomatic flavor.",0.7127203139,"
   ""I think it's like when a thief cries out: Catch the thieves!""

The humorous aspect of this translation is that the original phrase, Já si ale myslím, is often used in Czech to express one's own opinion or belief, similar to saying ""in my honest opinion"" or ""I think so"". The translator has taken this phrase and replaced it with a sentence that is quite different from the original, but still conveys the same idea of expressing one's own belief.

The humor in the translation comes from the fact that the English sentence ""Catch the thieves!"" is not at all what someone might expect to hear when they say ""I think it's like when a thief cries out"". It is a clever and unexpected twist on the original phrase, making it humorous.",0.5994861174,"

   But the truth is also that there are no complaints about public media.

In this example, the word ""ovšem"" (but) introduces a contrasting idea to what has been said before. The speaker suggests that while it is true that there are no complaints about public media, it does not mean that there are no stížnosti (complaints) at all.

The use of ""ovšem"" in this context emphasizes the nuance that just because there are no complaints about one thing (public media), it does not necessarily follow that there are no other issues or complaints present.",0.8689076266,"
   However, it is also true that there are no complaints about public media outlets.

The context of this sentence is important to understand why ""to"" (meaning ""there"") is used in the original Czech phrase and not translated into English. The speaker is pointing out a counterpoint to their previous statement, which was that stížnosti (complaints) exist towards private media outlets. By adding ""ovšem"" (however), they are introducing an opposing idea - that there are no complaints about public media outlets.

In this case, the use of ""to"" in the original Czech phrase serves to emphasize the contrast between the two situations: private and public media outlets. The translator has chosen not to translate ""to"" into English because it is not necessary to convey the meaning of the sentence, and also because doing so would sound awkward or forced in English. Instead, they have used a more natural-sounding phrase - ""However"" - to introduce the contrasting idea.",0.7559088222,"
   However, it is also true that there are no complaints about public media outlets.

The first thing to note here is that the word order in the original Czech sentence has been reversed in the translation. In Czech, the verb ""existovat"" (to exist) typically comes at the end of a sentence, so the phrase ""neexistovaly stížnosti na veřejnoprávní média"" can be translated as ""There were no complaints about public media outlets.""

The second thing to note is that the translator has used the word ""also"" in the translation to indicate that the existence of complaints about public media outlets is not the only aspect of the situation being discussed. This is a common way to translate the Czech word ""ovšem"", which can be translated as ""however"" or ""but"".

Overall, the translation is accurate and conveys the meaning of the original sentence well.",0.6336373466,"
   ""The truth is however also that there are no complaints about public media outlets.""

What could be a better translation of this phrase? How would you translate it if you wanted to convey the same meaning but with more accuracy and naturalness in English?  Please provide your answer along with an explanation.

The provided translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase, as it omits the nuance that ""stížnosti"" (complaints) exist, but are not necessarily directed at public media outlets specifically. A better translation could be:

""However, this doesn't mean there aren't complaints about other aspects of the media.""

This phrase captures the essence of the original Czech sentence by acknowledging that complaints do exist, while also making it clear that they are not necessarily focused on public media outlets.

Alternatively, another possible translation could be:

This phrase conveys a similar message to the previous one, while using slightly different wording to emphasize that criticisms do exist, even if they aren",0.7572963767,"However, it's not all good news as there are still complaints about public media.",0.6481694474

The masterful Czech-to-English translator has done an excellent job of conveying the meaning and nuances of the original Czech phrase into English, while also ensuring that the translation is idiomatic and natural-sounding. Here's why:

1. Accurate vocabulary: The translator uses precise English words to convey the meaning of the original Czech phrases. For example, ""vysvobozeno"" is translated as ""rescued,"" which accurately captures the idea of the puppy being set free from a difficult situation.
2. Idiomatic expressions: The translator uses idiomatic English expressions that are natural-sounding and easy to understand for native speakers. For example, ""požárními jednotkami"" is translated as ""firefighters,"" which is an idiomatic way of referring to the people who rescued the puppy.
3. Grammar: The translator accurately conveys",0.6080329566,"

How would you translate this sentence? Please provide your translation and an explanation of any differences between the original Czech phrase and your translation.

I would suggest the following translation:

""The puppy was rescued by firefighters after it became trapped on a dangerous protrusion 15 meters above ground.""

Here's why I made these changes:

* ""vysvobozeno"" is often translated as ""rescued"", but in this context, ""saved"" or ""liberated"" might be more appropriate.
* ""požárními jednotkami"" can be simplified to just ""firefighters"".

   How many people were injured in total and whether there are any fatalities is not yet clear.

In this example, the word ""celkem"" (meaning ""in total"") is used to indicate that we are referring to a comprehensive or overall count of something, rather than just a specific instance or individual case. The phrase ""zraněno"" (meaning ""injured"") is also used to refer to people who have been harmed or hurt in some way.

In the second sentence, the word ""ale"" is used to indicate that there may be additional information or details that are not yet known or confirmed. The phrase ""stále není zřejmé"" (meaning ""is not yet clear"") emphasizes that certain aspects of the situation are still unclear or uncertain.",0.7576564759,"
   How many people were injured in total and whether there are any fatalities is still unclear.

Here's why this translation is perfect:

1. Word-for-word translation: Kolik (how many) lidí (people) bylo (was/were) celkem (in total) zraněno (injured). This phrase is translated word-for-word, which ensures accuracy and precision.
2. Grammar preservation: The original Czech sentence follows a subject-verb-object structure, and the translation maintains this pattern, with ""How many people"" as the subject, ""were injured"" as the verb, and ""in total"" and ""is still unclear"" as objects.
3. Idiomatic expression: The translator uses the idiomatic phrase ""whether there are any fatalities,"" which is a common way to express this idea in English. This ensures that the translation sounds natural and native-like, rather than stilted or formal.
4. Contextual understanding: The translator clearly understands the context of the sentence, as they have captured the uncertainty and ambiguity implied by the phrase ""still unclear."" This is crucial for conve",0.3999014775,"
   How many people were injured in total and whether there are any fatalities is still unclear.

""The levels are altogether four, and in the most serious cases, we declare the fourth.""
  
This is an excellent translation of the original Czech phrase. Here's why:
  
1. Word-for-word accuracy: The translator has accurately translated each word in the original sentence into its English equivalent. For example, ""stupně"" is translated as ""levels,"" and ""čtyři"" is translated as ""four."" This ensures that the meaning of the original phrase is preserved in the translation.
  2. Grammatical accuracy: The translator has also maintained the grammatical structure of the original sentence. For example, the sentence is structured as a statement with two clauses (""The levels are altogether four"" and ""in the most serious cases, we declare the fourth""), which is consistent with English grammar.
  3. Idiomatic expression: The translator has used idiomatic expressions in the translation that convey the same meaning and tone as the original phrase. For example, ""the most serious cases"" is a common way to express the idea of severe situations in English.
  4. Cultural relevance: The translator has taken into account cultural differences between Czech and English",0.4825513438,"

What is wrong with this translation? Can you suggest an alternative way to translate it correctly?

Hint: The original sentence contains some idiomatic expressions and wordplay in Czech.

Answer: There are several issues with the given translation:

1. ""Věřím"" should be translated as ""I believe"" or ""I think,"" not ""I will believe.""
2. ""ve pátek večer"" is a more idiomatic way of saying ""on Friday evening"" in Czech, rather than using the literal translation.

The phrase is a sentence from an article about military operations in Syria and contains several technical terms that may require specific translation skills to accurately convey the meaning. Here's how I would approach translating this phrase:

1. Military aircraft: In Czech, ""vojenská letadla"" can be translated as ""military aircraft.""
2. attacked: The verb ""zaútočila"" is a bit more complex to translate, but it can be conveyed as ""attacked"" or ""targeted.""
3. Russian rockets: The phrase ""ruské rakety"" specifically refers to missiles or rockets produced in Russia. In English, this could be translated as ""Russian rockets.""
4. port city: The location where the attack took place is described as a ""přístavní město,"" which can be translated as ""port city.""

The correct answer is (B) There was always opposition at home to creating a federal Europe.",0.9117089718,"
   ""There was always resistance on home ground to create a federal Europe.""

The question is, what is wrong with this translation?

Hint: Look closely at the word order and verb tenses.

Answer: The problem with the translation is that it changes the original sentence's meaning by altering the word order and using an incorrect verb tense.

In Czech, ""Na domácí půdě"" means ""On home ground,"" not ""There was always resistance on home ground."" Additionally, the verb ""vytvořit"" is in the future tense, indicating that something has yet to be created or done, whereas ""create a federal Europe"" implies that such an entity already exists.

A more accurate translation of the phrase would be:

""On home ground, there will always be resistance to creating a federal Europe.""",0.7327245058,"But opposition at home has long stymied plans for a federal Europe...

Here's the breakdown of the original Czech phrase and its translation into ",0.8539020366,"
   In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a suspended sentence of 30 months.

My question is what does ""odkladem"" mean in this context? I understand that it means something like ""suspension"", but why is it used here instead of the more common word ""probation""? What's the difference between these two words, and when should each one be used?
\end{blockquote}

In Czech law, ""odkladem"" (suspension) and ""probace"" (probation) are both used to describe a type of sentence where the defendant is allowed to remain free in the community rather than being imprisoned. However, there is an important difference between the two words:

* Probace refers to a period of time during which the defendant is under supervision and must follow certain conditions, such as reporting regularly to a probation officer, maintaining employment or attending school, and staying away from certain people or places. If the defendant fails to comply with these conditions, they can be sent back to court and potentially receive a harsher sentence.
* Odkladem,",0.7911163705,"
   ""In April of 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a deferment of 30 months.""
The correct translation is:
""In April 2012, he was given an 18-month suspended sentence with a two-year probation period.""

Can you explain why the translator's version is incorrect and how it should be corrected?
Please provide explanations in both English and Czech. Thank you!

The correct translation of ""V dubnu 2012 byl nepravomocně odsouzen na 18 měsíců s odkladem na 30 měsíců"" is:

""In April 2012, he was given an 18-month suspended sentence with a two-year probation period.""

The translator's version ""In April of 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a deferment of 30 months"" is incorrect for several reasons:

* The word ""odsouzen"" in Czech means ""sentenced"", but the translator translated it as ""sentence",0.828038034,"In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison with a suspended sentence of 30 months.",0.9130695797

The sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but his family of a seventeen-year-old boy refuses to accept this.

Here is an explanation of how I arrived at my translation:

1. Šerifovi vyšetřovatelé - The phrase ""sheriff's investigators"" is a literal translation of the Czech words ""Šerifovi vyšetřovatelé"".
2. z okrsku Lowndes County - This phrase means ""from Lowndes County district"", where ""okrsek"" is an administrative division similar to a county in the United States.
3. učinili závěr, že Johnson zemřel nešťastnou náhodou - The sentence ""učinili závěr, že Johnson zemřel nešťastnou náhodou"" can be translated as ""they have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident"".
4. ale rodina sedmnáctiletého mladíka to odmítá - This sentence means ""but the family of a seventeen-year-old boy",0.8500018763,"
   Sheriffs investigators from Lowndes County made a conclusion that Johnson died of unfortunate accident, but the family of seventeen-year-old boy refuses this.

The correct translation is provided below:
  The sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died as a result of an unfortunate accident, but his family rejects this conclusion.

Can you spot the errors in the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version and explain them?

First error is ""Sherifovi"" instead of ""sheriff's"". The word ""sherif"" does not exist in English, it should be translated as ""sheriff's"" which is a possessive form.

Second error is ""vyšetřovatelé"" instead of ""investigators"". ""Vyšetřovatelé"" is a plural form and it doesn't match with the singular subject ""Sheriff's investigators"". The correct translation should be ""the sheriff's investigator"" or ""sheriff's investigators"" depending on the context.

Third error is ""učinili",0.8602977219,"Sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but his family refuses to accept it.

28,"Lidé platí přímo za to, co dostávají.",People are paying more directly into what they are getting.,"
   People pay for what they receive.

This proverb is often used to describe a situation where someone gets exactly what they paid for, without any additional benefits or perks. It can also be used to indicate that something has a direct and proportional cost.

For example, if you buy a car, you pay for the car itself, not for the promises of the salesman. In this case, you get exactly what you paid for - the car - and nothing more. The proverb ""Lidé platí přímo za to, co dostávají"" can be applied here because you are getting only what you paid for, without any additional perks or benefits.

Another example is when you pay for a service, like a haircut. You expect to get a certain level of quality and style, and if the stylist delivers on that promise, then you have gotten exactly what you paid for - a good haircut. In this case, the proverb can be applied because you are getting only what you paid for, without any additional perks or benefits.

The opposite of this proverb is ""Lidé platí za to, co nechtějí"" (People pay for things",0.4214840462,"
   People pay directly for what they receive.

I have some issues with this translation and I'd like you to review it. Here are my concerns:

1. The word order in the original phrase is different from the word order in the translation. In Czech, the verb ""platí"" comes before the object of the preposition ""za,"" while in English, we would typically place the object before the verb. So, should we prioritize word-for-word accuracy and keep the original word order, or should we prioritize idiomatic expression and rearrange the words to better fit English syntax?
2. The phrase ""what they receive"" might not be an exact equivalent of the Czech phrase ""co dostávají."" In Czech, the preposition ""za"" implies a causal relationship between the action of paying and the thing being paid for. In English, we don't have a direct equivalent of this preposition, so we might need to use a different phrasing to convey the same idea.
3. The phrase ""directly for what they receive"" could be interpreted as meaning that people are paid directly in exchange for the things they receive, which is not necessarily the intended meaning of the original",0.511136737,"
   People pay directly for what they receive.

The translation is correct and professional but lacks a certain je ne sais quoi that
  only a human touch can provide. Can you improve upon this machine-like
  translation? Please add a more natural, idiomatic, or poetic spin to the phrase.
\end{code}

Here's my attempt at adding a more natural and idiomatic spin to the translation:

The Czech phrase ""Lidé platí přímo za to, co dostávají"" can be translated into English as ""People pay for what they get, directly."" This version has a more conversational tone and better reflects the common idiomatic expression ""you get what you pay for,"" which is implied in the original phrase. Additionally, the word ""directly"" emphasizes the idea that there's a direct correlation between what someone pays and what they receive.",0.5818424662,"
   People pay directly for what they receive.

What's wrong with this translation?

   All three vocalists sang a little ditty together, ""Do Strane Srdca Useda"", which immediately filled the hall with excitement.

The word order in Czech is different from English, and the sentence structure is also different. In Czech, the verb ""zazpívali"" (they sang) comes before the subject ""všichni tři vocalisté"" (all three vocalists), whereas in English, the subject ""all three vocalists"" comes before the verb ""sang"". Additionally, in Czech, the adverb ""trošku"" (a little) modifies the verb ""zazpívali"", while in English, it is used to describe the ditty. Finally, the phrase ""Do stráně srdce usedá"" (To Strane Srdca Useda) is a Czech idiom that roughly translates to ""to the bottom of one's heart"".",0.6314425548,"
   All three vocalists sang a little ditty together, which immediately filled the auditorium with enthusiasm.

  However, upon closer inspection, there is one small issue with the translation: the word ""odrhovačku"" does not have an exact equivalent in English. The word ""ditty"" comes close, but it doesn't quite capture the same connotation as the original Czech phrase.
   To accurately translate the phrase into English, we might consider using a different word or phrase that better captures the lighthearted and playful nature of the original text. For example:
  All three vocalists sang a little tune together, which immediately filled the auditorium with joy and energy.
   This revised translation better conveys the carefree and lively spirit of the original Czech phrase, while still maintaining the basic meaning of the sentence.",0.5937285062,"
   All three vocalists sang a little ditty together, which immediately filled the hall with pride.

  Can you guess what might be an appropriate English idiom to replace ""odrhovačku"" in this context?

1913,Lze ho chápat jako úložku jedné měny a výpůjčku měny druhé.,It can be understood as a deposit in one currency and a loan in another currency.,"
   It can be understood as a container of one currency and a borrower of another.

In this sentence, the word ""ho"" is used to refer to something that is being contained or held by someone else (in this case, the first person). The word ""chápat"" means ""to understand"" or ""to perceive"", and in this context, it implies that the speaker is understanding the situation as one where they are holding a container of one currency and borrowing another.

The phrase ""úložka jedné měny"" literally means ""container of one currency"", and ""výpůjčka měny druhé"" means ""borrowing of another currency"". So, the sentence as a whole is saying that the speaker understands the situation as one where they are holding a container of one currency (their own) and borrowing another currency (from someone else).",0.7055754206,"
   It can be understood as a storage of one currency and a loan of another.

This is an excellent translation, but it doesn't capture the full nuance of the original Czech phrase. Let's break down why this might not fully convey the intended meaning in English.

Firstly, the word ""úložku"" has multiple meanings in Czech, including storage and deposit. However, the word ""chápat"" implies a more abstract understanding or interpretation of something, rather than just a physical storage space. So, the phrase as a whole could be interpreted as a way of thinking about one currency in terms of another, rather than simply storing it.

Furthermore, the use of ""vypojčku"" adds an additional layer of complexity to the translation. In English, this word is not commonly used and can be translated more directly as loan or borrowing. However, ""vypojčka"" implies a specific type of financial transaction where one party lends money to another with the expectation that it will be repaid in full, rather than simply being borrowed for personal use.

Therefore, while the translation is technically accurate, it may not fully convey the intended meaning and",0.4735845561,"
   It can be interpreted as a container of one currency and a borrower of another.

The given phrase is grammatically correct in Czech, but it uses an unusual word order that may not be commonly used or understood by native speakers. The translation provided by the masterful translator accurately conveys the meaning of the original phrase using more common English phrasing.",0.3649010088,"
   It can be understood as one money box and another money lender.

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: Think about what ""úložka"" means in Czech, and how it relates to ""vypojčení"".

Answer: The problem with the translation is that the word ""úložka"" does not have a direct equivalent in English. In Czech, ""úložka"" refers to a piggy bank or a money box, where you put your savings. However, the translator has translated it as ""money box"", which is not entirely accurate.

Moreover, the word ""vypojčení"" in Czech means lending or borrowing, but the translator has translated it as ""money lender"", which is not a common phrase in English. A more accurate translation of the original sentence would be:

1. They used ""perhaps"" to convey uncertainty, which is an important aspect of the original Czech phrase.
2. They used ""fully matured"" to capture the idea of the speaker's immaturity in this cultural stage.

The Czech phrase is quite colorful and vivid, with a playful use of language that captures the scene in a charming way. The English translation preserves this playfulness and charm, while also maintaining the original meaning and intent of the phrase.

Here are some key features of the Czech phrase:

   We know where they want you to work!

   We know where they want to hire you for work!

This translation captures the essence of the original Czech phrase and conveys it accurately in English. Here's why this is a good translation:

1. Word-for-word accuracy: The translator has translated each word of the original Czech phrase into its exact English equivalent, ensuring that the meaning remains intact. For example, ""víme"" (we know) and ""ctějí"" (they want to hire) are both accurately translated as ""know.""
2. Grammar accuracy: The translator has maintained the correct grammatical structure of the original Czech phrase in English. For example, the verb tenses and sentence structures are consistent between the two languages.
3. Cultural appropriateness: The translation is culturally appropriate for both languages. The use of ""we know"" and ""they want to hire"" accurately conveys the same level of formality and professionalism as the original Czech phrase.
4. Natural-sounding ",0.525601501,"
   We know where they want you to work!

The answer is correct. ""Víme"" can be translated as ""we know"", and ""cthějí"" is the first person plural form of the verb ""chtít"" meaning ""to want"". So the full phrase ""Víme, kde vás chtějí do práce!"" can be translated to English as ""We know where they want you to work!"".

Here's another example:

A Czech sentence is provided: Pijeme kořalku!.
  The efficient masterful Czech translator flawlessly translates the phrase into ",0.5957729106,"
   ""We know where you want to work!""

What's wrong with this translation? Why doesn't it convey the same meaning as the original phrase?

Hint: The word order is not the only thing that matters. Pay attention to the verb tenses and grammatical cases too!

Answer: There are several issues with the translator's version of the sentence:

1. Word order: In Czech, the subject (Víme) comes before the verb (chtějí), while in English, it is more common to put the subject after the verb (We know where you want to work!).
2. Tense: The original phrase uses the present tense (chtějí), which implies a current or ongoing desire for something. In contrast, the translator's version uses the future tense (will want), which doesn't convey the same sense of immediacy and continuity.
3. Case: In Czech, the verb agrees with the subject in case (Víme, where ""vás"" is in the dative case). The translator's version does not reflect this agreement, as ""where you want to work"" is in the nomin",0.3582383132,We know you want to work!,0.9347226381

How would you evaluate this translation? Do you think it is a good or bad translation? Why? Please provide specific reasons for your evaluation.

I would rate this translation as excellent because:

1. It accurately conveys the meaning of the original Czech phrase into English, using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure to convey the same information.
2. The translator has successfully captured the nuances of each word in the source language and translated them effectively into the target language while maintaining the context and intent of the original text. For example, ""odsouzen"" is accurately translated as ""sentenced,"" and ""spolčování"" as ""conspiring.""
3. The translation reads smoothly and naturally in English, without any noticeable errors or awkward phrasing that might indicate a poor translation.
4. The translator has also successfully conveyed the legal context of the sentence by using appropriate terminology such as ""guilty,"" ""sentenced,"" and ""prison."" This demonstrates a strong understanding of both languages and their",0.5927376273,"
   Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.

The question is: Is this translation perfect? If not, what could be improved?
\end{blockquote}

While the overall meaning of the translation is accurate, there are a few minor improvements that could be made:

1. ""Sám"" should be translated as ""alone"" or ""singularly,"" rather than ""only."" This would make the sentence more idiomatic in English.
2. The phrase ""poté, co"" can be simplified to just ""after."" This is a common omission in Czech-English translations.
3. Instead of using the wordy phrase ""spolčování za účelem dodávání,"" it would be more idiomatic to use the single word ""conspiracy.""
4. The sentence could benefit from some punctuation to make it easier to read and understand. For example, a period after ""years in prison"" or a set of commas after ""heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.""

With these improvements, the translation could",0.7104157782,"

  Questions:

    1) Is the translation correct?
    2) What is wrong with the translation?
    3) How would you improve the translation?
    4) What are some common mistakes that Czech translators make when translating legal texts from English to Czech, and how can they be avoided?

  Answers:

  1. No, the translation is not correct.
  2. The main issue with the translation is that it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase. In particular, ""spolčování"" in Czech cannot be directly translated to ""conspiring"" as it implies a more limited scope and intent than the English word. Additionally, ""dodávání"" should be translated as ""supplying"", not ""delivering"".
  3. To improve the translation, the translator could have used phrases such as ""Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison for his involvement in supplying heroin, cocaine and marijuana",0.7125842506,"Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to distribute heroin, cocaine and marijuana.",0.9556010258

The use of precise vocabulary and grammar ensures that the translation is accurate and natural-sounding, allowing for effective communication between languages.",0.3812688731,"
   ""They should have it by the end of the year.""

The correct translation for this idiomatic expression in standard American
  English is:
   ""They will have it by the end of the year.""

Here's why:

1. The original phrase uses the verb ""navrhnout"" which means to plan, intend or have scheduled. This implies that someone has something planned or intended to be done by the end of the year.
2. In English, we use the future tense (will have) instead of the present tense (have) because it's a prediction about the future and not a current state.
3. The word ""should"" is often used in informal situations to express an opinion or expectation rather than a fact. However, in this case, it's more appropriate to use ""will have"" since it's a statement of what is expected to happen based on the original plan.

Therefore, the correct translation for the given Czech phrase into standard American English would be:
   ""They will have it by the end of the year.""",0.6840224192,"

How did the translator manage to translate this phrase so accurately? What techniques or strategies did they use? This essay will explore how the translator used various translation techniques to produce a high-quality English version of the original Czech phrase.

1. Analysis of the Original Phrase

The original Czech phrase is quite long and contains several clauses, which can make it challenging to translate accurately. To begin with, let's analyze the structure of the phrase:

Od roku 2010 působí jako vedoucí oddělení ošetřovatelství a dalších nelékařských oborů (Since 2010, I have been serving as the head of the nursing and other non-medical departments)

\end{question}

The provided Czech phrase is:

Problém je však v pórovitosti a malé soudržnosti hornin, které rychle zvětrávají, rozpadají se a sesouvají po svahu dolů.

And the incompetent masterful translator's translation is:

""The problem is however with the porosity and small cohesion of rocks which quickly erode, disintegrate and slide downhill.""

This translation is not a good one for several reasons:

1. The word order is not natural in English. In English, we would say ""quickly erode"" instead of ""which quickly erode"".
2. The phrase ""disintegrate and slide downhill"" is not idiomatic. It's not a common way to express the idea that rocks are sliding down",0.6526256751,"The problem is that the soil is porous and has poor bearing capacity, which quickly erodes and slides downhill.",0.8809210639
2310,"Taková je bohužel realita, ve které musím žít.","That’s the reality, unfortunately, in which I have to live.","
   This is unfortunately the reality I have to live in.

   Such is unfortunately my reality that I have to live in.

How did the translator do? Here's a breakdown of their performance:

* Accuracy: 👍 The translator accurately conveyed the meaning and tone of the original phrase, capturing its nuances and idiomatic expressions.
* Fluency: 🔥 The translation flows smoothly and naturally, with no awkward or stilted phrasing.
* Contextual appropriateness: 👍 The translator understood the context of the sentence and translated it accordingly, using appropriate vocabulary and idioms for the target language.

Overall, the masterful Czech translator has done an excellent job in rendering the phrase into English!",0.2674956474,"
   Such is unfortunately reality, which I have to live in.

This translation captures the essence of the original Czech phrase perfectly, but it may not be a word-for-word translation. Here's why:

1. Word order: The word order in Czech and English phrases is different. In Czech, the verb ""muset"" (have to) comes before the subject ""jeden"" (I), while in English, the subject usually comes before the verb. So, the word order in the translation is more common in English than in Czech.
2. Prepositions: The preposition ""ve"" (in) in Czech is not directly translated into English. Instead of using a preposition, the translator chose to use the phrase ""which I have to live,"" which conveys the same meaning but with a different structure.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The original Czech phrase contains an idiomatic expression ""taková je bohužel realita"" (such is unfortunately reality), which may not be directly translatable into English. The translator chose to convey the same idea using the phrase ""unfortunately reality,"" which is more common in English.
4. Grammar: Czech",0.3346098468,"
   ""Such is unfortunately reality which I have to live.""

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: There are two main errors. One of them is related to word order, and the other one is a mistranslation of the meaning of the original sentence.

""Rather believes that dogs from experience have learned what movements they must and need not pay attention to.""
  
I would like to challenge this translation, as I believe it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase. Here is my suggested alternative translation:

""More likely assumes that dogs have learned through experience which actions they can take without paying attention and which ones require attention."" 

My reasoning for suggesting this alternative translation is as follows:

1. The word ""pohyby"" in the original Czech phrase refers to movements or actions, rather than simply ""paying attention"". This is important because it emphasizes that dogs have learned specific behaviors through experience, rather than just focusing their attention on certain stimuli.
2. The phrase ""nemusí dávat pozor"" suggests that there are certain actions that dogs can perform without needing to pay close attention to them. This implies a level of automaticity or habitual behavior, which is not fully conveyed by the translation ""need not pay attention"".
3. By using the phrasing ""which actions they can take without paying attention"" in my suggested alternative translation, we emphasize that dogs have learned specific behaviors through",0.738040722,"
  
  Dogs are more likely to have learned from experience what movements they should and shouldn't pay attention to.

2. Incorrect syntax: The translator might have used an incorrect sentence structure or word order in the target language. For example, the phrase ""which then begin to produce"" could be rephrased as ""that cause them to produce"".

There are several issues with the provided translation:

1. ""selectively infects"" should be translated as ""infektovat selektivně"", not ""selektivně infikuje"". The word order is reversed, which changes the meaning of the phrase.
2. ""buňky jater"" should be translated as ""liver cells"", not just ""cells"". This is a more specific term that accurately reflects the original Czech phrasing.

   So, the route with the company Frontier is long - 1000 miles purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of $250.

In this sentence, there are several grammatical errors that make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Here's a breakdown of the issues and suggested corrections:

1. Takže (meaning ""therefore"") should be placed at the beginning of the sentence instead of in the middle. This will help clarify the relationship between the previous statement and the one being made now.
2. Cesta (meaning ""route"" or ""journey"") is a feminine noun, so it should be preceded by an article in the feminine form (i.e., ""je"").
3. Se (meaning ""with"") should be changed to ""společností"" (meaning ""with the company""), as Frontier is a company and not a person or group of people.
4. Zakoupená (meaning ""purchased"") is in the past tense, but it would make more sense in this context to use the present perfect tense to indicate that the purchase has been made and is still relevant",0.7383898033,"
   Therefore, the journey with society Frontier long 1000 miles purchased over the internet travel agency means a reward of $250.

   Here is what I think should be done to improve this translation:

    - The word ""odměna"" (reward) could simply be translated as ""refund"". This would make the meaning more clear and direct, especially for English speakers who may not be familiar with the Czech word.
    - The phrase ""purchased over the internet travel agency"" is a bit awkward in English. It might be better to say something like ""booked online through a travel agency"". This would make the sentence more natural and easier to understand.

   Here is the improved translation:

     Therefore, the journey with society Frontier long 1000 miles booked online through a travel agency means a refund of $250.",0.7323708416,"

The word ""obžalovaný"" is a noun that can be translated to English as ""accused"". However, in this context, it would be more appropriate to use the adjective form ""obžalovaná"", which means ""accused"" or ""charged"". So, the correct translation of the phrase should be:

At the location, no traces of any accused individuals were found.",0.6133918651,"

The provided Czech phrase ""Na místě se nenašla žádná DNA obžalovaných"" can be translated into English as follows:

Incompetent translation: ""On spot no any accused DNA found"".
Expert translation: ""No DNA evidence of the accused was found at the scene.""

Issue 1: Incorrect word order
The incompetent translation has a wrong word order, which changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct word order should be ""no DNA evidence of the accused was found"" instead of ""no any accused DNA found"". This is because ""DNA evidence"" is a unitary concept and cannot be divided into two separate parts like that.

220,Hamé dodává kysané zelí především na tuzemský a slovenský trh.,Hamé group supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.,"
   The company Hame is primarily focused on delivering pickled cucumbers to the domestic and Slovak markets.

In this example, we can see that the word ""tuzemský"" (domestic) is used to describe the market in which the product is sold. This word is not commonly used in other contexts, so it's unlikely that you would encounter it outside of a discussion about business or trade. However, if you do come across it, now you know what it means!

Here are some more examples of words that might be unfamiliar to English speakers:

* ""tuzemská"" (domestic) - used to describe something that is from the home country
* ""zahraniční"" (foreign) - used to describe something that is from a foreign country
* ""evropský"" (European) - used to describe something that is related to Europe or the European Union
* ""světový"" (global) - used to describe something that is worldwide in scope or application

However, I would like to point out that there is an error in the translation. Specifically:

This sentence is nonsensical because it contains several contradictory elements. Cats do not have the ability to shrink objects, presidents do not bury things, and berries are a type of fruit that does not typically contain other objects. Additionally, the phrase ""skončil o berlích"" is grammatically incorrect in Czech.

A more natural-sounding English version might be: ""The dog gobbled up a blanket, so the president buried it and ended up in Berlin."" This translation maintains the basic idea of the original sentence but uses wording that is more common in everyday English conversation to convey its meaning more effectively.
  The phrase Pes shrnul koberec can be broken down into several components:
  1) ""Pes"" means dog, and ""shrnul"" is a verb that means swallowed or gobbled up.

No, this is not a correct translation. The phrase ""Podle NRF se očekává"" can be translated to English as ""According to NRF (National Retail Federation) it is expected that..."", but the rest of the sentence does not make sense in English.

The problem is that the original Czech phrase is using a wrong idiomatic expression, which is not easily translatable into English. In Czech, ""půjde"" is an incorrect usage of the verb ""použít"" (to use) and it sounds unnatural in this context.

 The word order in the two sentences is different because of the way that the information is being presented. In the original sentence, the fact that the speaker was given female hormones is presented as a completed action in the past (i.e., ""I received female hormones""). In the translation, the same information is presented as an ongoing state that began 12 years ago (""In 12 years, I have been receiving female hormones"").

The word order in the two sentences also reflects a difference in emphasis. The original sentence emphasizes the completion of the action of receiving the hormones, while the translation emphasizes the ongoing nature of the recipient's gender identity.",0.77088048,"

What's wrong with this translation? What would be a correct way to translate it?

There are several issues with the given translation:

1. The word order is incorrect. In English, we would say ""he was given female hormones at the age of 12"" or ""at the age of 12, he was prescribed female hormones.""
2. The phrase ""ženské hormony"" should be translated as ""female hormones,"" not just ""hormones."" This is important because the word ""ženské"" specifically refers to things related to women or femininity.
3. The verb tense is incorrect. The past perfect tense (""dostal"") suggests that the action of receiving the hormones happened before another past event, but it's not clear what that event might be. A more appropriate verb tense would be the simple past (""received"").

The translation is accurate and clear, conveying the intended meaning of the original Czech phrase while also taking into account cultural differences and nuances between languages.

Hint: The word order in the original Czech sentence is not the same as in English. Pay attention to verb tenses!

The problem with the translation is that it does not convey the correct meaning of the original Czech phrase. Here's a corrected version:

According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports will have three designations instead of M (man) and F (woman), including X for intersex individuals - starting from now [or in the future].

The issue is that the original Czech sentence uses the present tense ""budou mít"" (they will have), while English typically uses the future tense to express something that will start at a specific point in time.

791,Po narození jsem byl sterilizován a nikdo mi nikdy nic neřekl.,I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.,"
   I was born sterile and no one has ever told me anything about it.

Note that the word ""sterilizován"" is an adjective, not a verb, so it should be translated as ""sterile"", not ""was sterilized"". Also, the phrase ""nikdy nic neřekl"" can be translated more idiomatically as ""no one has ever told me anything about it.""",0.8324651304,"
   After birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.

The word ""sterilization"" is not in common usage as a verb in English to describe what happens after birth. Is there another way this phrase could be translated? Are there any other ways the Czech phrase could be rendered into idiomatic English?
\end{blockquote}

Yes, there are several alternative ways to translate the Czech phrase ""Po narození jsem byl sterilizován"" into idiomatic English. Here are a few options:

1. After birth, I was surgically sterilized: This translation is more literal and retains the medical connotation of the original phrase.
2. Born with a vasectomy: This option is less common but still conveys the idea that the speaker was sterilized shortly after birth.
3. I was snipped as an infant: This colloquialism refers to a type of surgical sterilization called a vasectomy, which can be used to translate the Czech phrase.
4. My parents had me fixed when I was born: This idiomatic expression is more general and doesn't specify the exact method of sterilization",0.7227243247,"
   After birth, I was sterilized and nobody ever told me anything.

The joke is that in this translation, the word ""sterilizován"" (meaning ""sterilized"") has been translated literally as ""sterilized"", without any regard for its grammatical gender or agreement with other words in the sentence. The result is a nonsensical English sentence where the subject ""I"" and the verb ""was"" do not agree in number, and the word ""nobody"" does not match the previous phrase ""anyone"".

This joke plays on the fact that Czech and English have different grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions, and that a literal translation of a sentence from one language to another can often result in nonsensical or humorous phrases.",0.7470795972,"

What is wrong with this translation? What would be a more appropriate way of translating this phrase from Czech to English?

The problem with the incompetent masterful Czech translator's translation is that they have used an unnatural, word-for-word translation instead of conveying the meaning and nuance of the original Czech sentence. Here are some issues:

1. ""Po narození"" should be translated as ""After birth,"" not ""After being born."" The phrase ""being born"" is not commonly used in English, so it sounds unnatural to native speakers.
2. ""jsem byl sterilizován"" should be translated as ""I was sterilized,"" not ""I was sterilized and nobody ever said anything to me about it.""

The word ""Jakékoliv"" is a filler word that can be translated as ""any"", ""whatsoever"", or ""whatever"". It's used to indicate that all possible solutions are included in the statement. The sentence itself is negative, expressing the idea that no solution will improve the current state of political culture, which is already low.

In this context, ""Jakékoliv jiné řešení"" can be translated as ""any other solution"", emphasizing that all possible alternatives are included in the statement. The word order in Czech sentences is different from English, so the verb ""sníží"" (will lower) comes before the subject ""úroveň politické kultury"" (level of political culture).",0.773694075,"

The context is a discussion about what steps could be taken to improve the current state of politics and governance in a country.

The above translation is a perfect example of how the term ""flawed translation"" can be misleading, as it implies that there is something inherently wrong with the translation itself, when in fact the problem lies with the source language phrase being translated. In this case, the original Czech phrase contains a complex concept that does not have an exact equivalent in English, and therefore any attempt to translate it will necessarily result in a less than perfect rendering of the intended meaning.

In general, what is considered a ""flawed translation"" is often more accurately described as a ""suboptimal translation,"" or perhaps simply a ""translation that does not fully capture the nuances of the original language.""

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: Think about the meaning of ""pohlázení"" and ""motivuje"".

Answer: The word ""pohlázení"" in Czech means ""petting"", not ""pleasure"". So, the correct translation should be:

""Petting a domestic cat inspires 78.7% of people to wash their hands.""",0.68673871,"
  
    ""The pleasure of petting a domestic cat inspires 78.7% of people to wash their hands.""

   ""The satisfaction of a domestic pet's cuddles encourages 78.7% of people to wash their hands.""

Question: What is wrong with this translation?

Answer: There are several issues with this translation:

1. The original Czech phrase is in the form of a sentence, while the English translation is in the form of a list item (e.g., ""78.7% of people""). This changes the meaning and tone of the phrase significantly.
2. The word ""pohlázení"" does not have a direct English equivalent. It is often translated as ""cuddles,"" but this does not convey the full range of meanings that the word has in Czech, including the idea of affectionate touch or caressing.
3. The phrase ""motivuje k mytí rukou"" means ""encourages to wash one's hands,"" but this is not explicitly stated in the English translation. Instead, the translator has chosen to focus on the idea of cuddling a pet, which is only loosely related to hand-washing.
4. The percentages do not match up correctly between the two languages",0.7268424667,78.7 percent of people are motivated to wash their hands after petting a cute little cat.,0.7690951753

   A persistent theory on how to deal with children of uncertain sex was proposed by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is malleable.

In this sentence, the word ""pohlaví"" in Czech has a specific meaning related to biological sex, while the word ""gender"" in English has a broader meaning encompassing social and cultural aspects of masculinity and femininity as well. The translation should convey both meanings of ""pohlaví"" (biological sex and gender) into English using the appropriate term or phrase.

The correct answer is:

A persistent theory on how to deal with children of uncertain biological sex was proposed by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender identity is malleable.",0.8737514472,"
  
The persistent theory on how to handle children with ambiguous gender was proposed by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is malleable.

This translation captures the meaning of the original Czech phrase in a highly accurate and natural-sounding way. The translator has successfully conveyed the idea that Dr. Money's theory on gender was not only influential but also controversial, as it suggested that gender can be shaped or molded to fit individual preferences or needs.
  
The use of ""malleable"" in the translation is particularly effective, as it conveys the idea that gender is a flexible and adaptable concept, rather than a fixed or immutable one. Additionally, the translator's choice of words such as ""persistent theory"" and ""handle children with ambiguous gender"" helps to convey the sense of ongoing debate and discussion surrounding this topic.
  Overall, this translation is highly commendable for its accuracy, fluency, and nuanced understanding of the original Czech phrase.",0.7671145533,"
   Pertaining to children with ambiguous gender, a persistent theory on how to handle them was proposed by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is malleable..

1) Why was ""státní zástupce"" translated as ""state representative""? I would expect it to be simply ""prosecutor"".
2) The original phrase uses the word ""rozhodnutím"", which means ""decision"". However, in the translation, this is rendered as ""by this decision"". Is there a particular reason for this choice?
3) In English, we would say ""criminal proceedings"" to refer to the legal process against the members. Why did the translator choose to use ""trestní řízení""? This word doesn't seem to be commonly used in English.
4) Finally, why does the translation have a period at the end? In Czech, this sentence would not have a period.

I appreciate any clarification you can provide regarding these points!",0.8565224391,"

The correct translation is:

Note that in Czech, the word ""popravčí"" is used for both ""firing squad"" and ""gallows"". In this case, it seems clear from the context that Mrs. Corteenova was advocating for a more severe punishment than hanging, so I have translated as ""firing squad"".",0.7228787065,"
   ""The lady's agent, Mrs. Corteenova, said that he should be put before a firing squad.""

In this example, the word order in the original Czech phrase is different from the word order in the translation. Specifically, the verb ""řekla"" (said) appears after the object of the sentence (""agenturu""), rather than before it as would be more common in English. This difference in word order can affect the overall meaning and emphasis of the sentence.

The correct translation is actually:

Please provide an explanation of why the original Czech phrase was translated incorrectly and what were the main errors made by the translator?

I'm happy to help you with this! As a native English speaker and a professional translator, I can explain where the translation went wrong.

Firstly, let me point out that the original Czech phrase ""Měl by být postaven před popravčí četu"" is not entirely correct in itself. The word ""popravčí"" should be ""vojenský"" (military) instead, so the correct phrase would be ""Měl by být postaven před vojenskou četou.""

1. Incorrect word order: In Czech, the phrase is structured as ""Měl by být postaven před [",0.7005731825,"

The given phrase contains several technical terms that require accurate translation to ensure proper understanding of the text. Here are some common mistakes that Czech-to-English translators might make when dealing with technical terminology:

1. Incorrect usage of ""ze"" vs. ""from"": The correct preposition to use in this context would be ""from,"" not ""ze."" This is a common mistake made by non-native English speakers, as the two words are similar in Czech and can easily be confused.

   In reality, there are officially 1200 haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue each year according to the American Haunted Houses Company. These include those amazing scary photos you see on Facebook and can't remove, and your friends who like them will probably leave a comment saying ""you look great.""

The text is trying to convey that haunted houses are not just a myth but an actual business with significant revenue. The author uses the phrase ""officially 1200"" to emphasize that this is a factual number and not just a rumor or speculation. Additionally, they mention the American Haunted Houses Company as a source of information, which adds credibility to the claim.

The second part of the text is more playful and lighthearted, using colloquial language like ""počůraní strachy"" (which roughly translates to ""scaredy-cat"") to describe someone who is easily frightened by haunted houses. The author also uses a humorous tone when describing the Facebook photos, saying that they can't be removed and will likely receive positive comments from friends. Overall, the text",0.9216642981,"
   In reality, there are officially 1200 haunted houses in the United States that bring in $500 million annually to the American Haunted Houses company, and they own those amazing pictures of you looking spooked, which your friend on Facebook can't stop sharing, and you can't get rid of them. And that person who likes you will see the picture and leave a comment like ""You look so cute!""

The phrase is translated accurately, but it sounds unnatural in English because it is written more formally than how native speakers would express themselves. Additionally, some phrases are worded differently in Czech versus English, such as ""zasvěcených"" (Czech) vs. ""officially"" (English), and ""nemůžete odstranit"" (Czech) vs. ""you can't get rid of them"" (English).

Here is a more natural-sounding translation:

The translator is efficient because it uses an existing phrase in English to convey the meaning of the original Czech sentence. The word ""spooky houses"" is already used in English to refer to haunted houses or other places that are intended to be scary, and the phrase ""officially sanctioned"" means that something is recognized or approved by a government or authority. By using these existing phrases, the translator can convey the meaning of the original sentence without having to use overly complex language or invent new words.

The translator is also masterful because it accurately conveys the tone and style of the original Czech phrase in English. The use of the word ""breathtaking"" to describe the photos, for example, captures the sense of wonder and awe that is implied by the Czech",0.894823007,"
   In reality, there are officially 1200 terrifying houses in the United States that have according to the American Scary Houses Company a revenue of 500 million dollars and they belong to those amazing pictures, on which you are frightened and your friend on Facebook will share them and you can't remove them and that person who likes you will see the picture and write a comment like ""you look cute"".

  But then you realize that this translation is not quite right, as there are a few issues:
  1) The word ""zmrzlina"" can be translated to English as ""icing"", but in this context it seems more appropriate to use the word ""frosting"". However, even using frosting does not fully convey the correct meaning of the original phrase. 2) The word ""jazykem konzumenta"" is a bit tricky - it can be translated to English as ""consumer's tongue"", but the word ""tongue"" in this context seems a bit misleading, since it implies that the frosting only affects the tongue and not other parts of the body. 3) The phrase ""zvyšuje hladinu pH v bílkovině"" is somewhat difficult to translate accurately - it would be more appropriate to use the word ""raises"" instead of ""increases"", and also, the word ""bílkovina"" can be translated as either ""protein"" or",0.6697455983,"

2346,"Že si se ženou můžeme vybrat, kde budeme žít.",That my wife and I can choose where we will live.,"
   ""So we can choose where we will live together""

This is a more romantic way of saying that you and your partner have decided to move in together. The phrase ""že si se ženou"" means ""where we will live"", and the word ""můžeme"" is used to indicate possibility or ability. So the whole sentence can be translated as ""we can choose where we will live together"".",0.7989484949,"
  
""That we can choose each other where we will live.""
  
The translation is a bit awkward and doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the original Czech phrase. Here's why:
  
In Czech, ""že si se ženou můžeme vybrat"" is a more idiomatic way of saying ""we can choose each other."" The word ""vybrat"" has a connotation of selecting or choosing something carefully, and in this context, it implies that we are choosing our partner deliberately and with care.
  
In English, the phrase ""That we can choose each other where we will live"" is more literal and doesn't convey the same sense of careful selection. It sounds like a statement of fact rather than an expression of love or commitment.
  
A better translation might be: ""We can choose to live together."" This conveys the idea that we are making a deliberate decision to share our lives with each other, and it has a more romantic tone.",0.4332445229,"
   ""That we can choose a wife with whom we will live.""

Yes, this is a good translation for several reasons:

1. Accuracy: The translator has accurately conveyed the meaning of the original Czech phrase into English. The use of ""typically"" and ""one after another"" captures the essence of the Czech phrase, which emphasizes that the project of building highways has become a common occurrence in the country.
2. Clarity: The translation is clear and easy to understand for an English speaker who may not be familiar with the original Czech phrase. The use of simple language and short sentences makes it accessible to a wide audience.
3. Fluency: The translator has used appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure to convey the meaning of the original phrase in a fluent manner. For example, ""intensive debate"" is a common English phrase that accurately conveys the idea of a heated discussion.
4. Cultural sensitivity: The translation takes into account cultural",0.6309513105,"

Note: The word order is different between Czech and English. In Czech, it is more common to place adverbs at the end of a sentence, while in English they are usually placed closer to the verb or noun they modify. Additionally, the word ""turns out"" is not typically used in formal writing in English.",0.7349485927,"
   And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom jet chased after an American drone in international airspace over the sea, possibly marking the first ever deployment of the US F-22 Raptor stealth fighter.

Here is a breakdown of how the translator achieved this excellent translation:

1. Word order: The Czech phrase uses a different word order than English, with the verb ""se stalo"" (it happened) at the end of the sentence. The translator preserved the original word order to maintain the meaning and flow of the sentence.
2. Idiomatic expression: The Czech phrase uses an idiomatic expression ""A tak se stalo,"" which is equivalent to ""And so it happened."" The translator retained this expression in English to convey the same connotation.
3. Technical terms: Both phrases use technical terms related to aviation, such as ""F-4 Phantom"" and ""F-22 Raptor."" The translator accurately translated these terms into English.
4. Grammar: The Czech phrase uses a different grammatical structure than English, with no verb agreement between the subject and predicate. The translator adjusted the grammar",0.7476306616,"
   And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom pursued an American drone in international airspace over the sea, possibly marking the first operational use of the US Air Force's F-22 Raptor in history.

The translator's task is to provide a clear and natural English translation of the given Czech sentence, while taking into account any cultural or linguistic differences that may affect the meaning. Here are some possible improvements for the provided translation:
  * The phrase ""And so it happened"" could be shortened to simply ""It happened"" to make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding in English.
  * Instead of using the word ""superfighter,"" which is not commonly used in everyday language, the translator could use a more straightforward term like ""stealth fighter"" or just ""F-22 Raptor.""

What does this translation convey, and how might it differ from a more accurate or idiomatic translation?

In this case, the translation ""It's so darn confusing..."" conveys the general sense of the original Czech phrase, but it may not fully capture its nuances or idiomatic expression. Here are some possible differences:

1. Word choice: The word ""darn"" is more colloquial and informal than a more neutral translation like ""very"" or ""extremely."" This might make the translation sound less formal or professional.

A more accurate translation might be something like ""It's so bewildering..."" or ""It's so mind-boggling..."", but these phrases don't quite convey the same colloquial tone as the original Czech phrase.

Question: What is wrong with this translation? Can you suggest a better way to translate it?

Answer: There are several issues with the given translation:

2. The phrase ""je pro děti"" should be translated as ""is for children"" or ""targeted at children,"" not ""has the name Magic Cliff - Kaluoka'hina.""
3. The word ""Kaluoka'hina"" is a made-up word and doesn't have an English translation. It seems to be a mistake in the original Czech phrase.

Or, if you want to emphasize that it's targeted at children:

Note that the word "" cíl"" can also mean ""target"", so there is a pun in the original sentence.",0.8377147283,"
   ""The goal was to have Russian rockets for Hezbollah.""

However, there are a few issues with this translation. Firstly, the word
  ""Cílem"" is not quite correct, as it can also mean ""aim"", and in this case,
  a more appropriate word would be ""plán"". Secondly, ""měly být"" should be
  translated as ""were supposed to be"" or ""were intended to be"", rather
  than simply ""should be"". Finally, ""Hizballáh"" is not an English word and
  should be spelled ""Hezbollah"". With these corrections, the correct
  translation of the phrase would be:

The goal was supposed to be Russian rockets for Hezbollah.",0.7282617617,"
   ""The target should have been Russian rockets for Hezbollah.""

However, there is a small issue with this translation. What exactly is wrong?

Hint: Look closely at the word order in the original Czech sentence and compare it to the word order in the English translation.

Answer: The problem lies in the word order of the two sentences. In Czech, the phrase ""Cílem měly být"" puts the emphasis on the target (cilem) being something that was intended or planned, whereas in English, the phrase ""The target should have been"" places the emphasis on the idea that the target was not achieved or fulfilled.

In Czech, the sentence is structured as a passive construction, with ""měly být"" (should have been) being used to indicate the intended goal or purpose, and ""ruské rakety"" (Russian rockets) being the object of the phrase. In English, however, the word order is different, with ""The target"" coming first, followed by ""should have been,"" and then ""Russian rockets."" This changes the emphasis and meaning of the sentence.

Therefore, a more accurate translation of the Czech",0.7088059627,"

The joke relies on wordplay in both languages, as ""ošklíbáte"" (Czech) and ""exerting yourself"" (English) sound similar but have different meanings. The phrase also uses the hyperbole of reducing something by half a kilogram every year to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.

The joke is funny because it takes an ordinary, mundane activity like swatting at flies and exaggerates it to ridiculous proportions, highlighting the absurdity of our daily habits and the amount of energy we spend on them. It also plays with the idea that we often don't realize how much time and effort we put into things until they are pointed out to us in a humorous way.",0.7105127161,"
   Maybe you are exaggerating about the insects and unknowingly eat half a kilogram of them every year voluntarily.

The correct translation would be:

What is the difference between these two translations? How does the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version differ from the correct one? What are some common mistakes made by non-native English speakers when translating idiomatic expressions, and how can they be avoided?

The main differences between the two translations are:

1. The word order: In the correct translation, ""around half a kilogram"" comes before ""every year,"" while in the incorrect translation, it comes after.
2. The use of ""unaware of it"": The correct phrase is ""unaware of it,"" which emphasizes that the person does not know they are eating insects. In the incorrect translation, this nuance is lost.

In English, ""fetters"" typically refers to physical restraints or shackles, whereas ""pouta"" in Czech can also imply psychological or emotional bonds. To more accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence, a different word choice might be necessary.

So let's try again:
   Central bankers have been strengthening the ties that began to form in 2007 when the international credit market dried up for the first time.

 Is this a good translation? Why or why not? What would be a better way to translate the original sentence?
\end{blockquote}

No, this is not a good translation for several reasons:

1. Inaccurate vocabulary choice: ""bonds"" in English refers specifically to financial instruments used by governments and corporations to raise capital, whereas the Czech phrase ""pouta"" does not have that specific connotation. A more appropriate word in this context would be ""ties"" or ""links"".
2. Incorrect syntax: The original sentence is structured as a single clause with two main verbs (""posilují"" and ""zadrhly""), while the translation breaks it up into two separate clauses, which can make it less clear and more awkward to read.
3. Lack of precision: The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, especially in terms of the timing and nature of the event being described (the international credit market ""drying up"" is not an accurate description of what happened in 2",0.770576841,"""Central bankers are strengthening the chains that began to form in 2007 when the international credit market first froze.""

Is this a correct translation? What does the original Czech phrase mean and how would you translate it correctly into English?

Certainly! Let me help you with this one. 😊

The original Czech phrase is: ""Můžete mít dobré úmysly, ale uděláte lépe, když si je necháte pro sebe.""

This phrase is a bit tricky to translate directly into English because it contains a double meaning of the word ""udělat"" (to do). In Czech, ""uděláte"" can mean both ""you do something"" and ""it goes well for you."" The first translation would imply that the person has done something good, while the second one suggests that things are going well for them.

   In the countries of West Africa, there are not many doctors; only one for 5,000 inhabitants.

In this sentence, the word ""zemích"" (translated as ""countries"") is in the plural form. The word ""lékařů"" (translated as ""doctors"") is also in the plural form. However, the word ""obyvatel"" (translated as ""inhabitants"") is in the singular form.

In English, it would be more appropriate to use the plural form of ""inhabitants"" to match the plural forms of ""doctors"" and ""countries"". Therefore, the correct sentence should be:

Hint: Consider the nuances of language and cultural differences.",0.8837035245,"
   In the countries of Western Africa, there are not many doctors; only one for 5,000 inhabitants.

How does this translation differ from a literal translation? What additional nuances or connotations have been conveyed in the masterful translation?

In this case, the difference between the original Czech phrase and its English translation is relatively subtle but significant. Here are some of the key differences:

1. Word order: The word order in the two phrases is different. In Czech, the phrase starts with ""V zemích západní Afriky"" (In the countries of Western Africa), while in English, it starts with ""There are not many doctors"" (a more direct and concise way to express the idea).
2. Prepositions: The preposition ""v"" in Czech is translated as ""in"" in English, which changes the emphasis slightly. In Czech, the focus is on the countries where there are few doctors, while in English, the focus is more on the fact that there are not many doctors overall.
3. Numbers: The numbers used in each phrase convey different nuances. In Czech, ""příliš mnoho"" (",0.7154517128,"
   ""In the countries of Western Africa, there are not enough doctors; only one doctor for every five thousand inhabitants.""

   ""Alan Aldridge from Keighley said: 'We were worried it might fall down, but it stayed there.'""

In this sentence, the verb tense is not consistent. The past simple ""báli jsme se"" (we were worried) does not match the present perfect ""zůstal tam"" (it stayed there). It would be better to use a more consistent verb tense throughout the sentence. Here's one possible revision:

""Mr. Alderson from Keighley said: 'We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.'"".
  
Perfect! But here's a twist: what if we wanted to translate this phrase not just
  word-for-word, but also culturally? In other words, how would we convey the
  nuances of the original Czech phrase in English, taking into account the
  cultural differences between the two languages and societies?
  
One way to approach this task is to consider the context in which the phrase
  is being used. For example, if the phrase is being spoken by a character in a
  novel set in the Czech Republic, we might want to convey the sense of
  nostalgia or longing that underlies the original phrase. On the other hand,
  if the phrase is being used in a more formal or professional setting, we
  might focus on conveying the sense of reliability and stability implied by
  the word ""stayed.""
  
Another approach would be to consider the connotations of individual words
  within the original phrase. For example, the word ""báli"" (af",0.5527553716,"
   Mr. Alderson from Keighley said: ""We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.""

I'm sure you will agree that this is a perfect translation of the original sentence

The given translation is incorrect because it does not convey the same meaning as the original Czech phrase. Here's why:

No, the translation is not idiomatic and sounds unnatural in English. Here's why:

The original Czech phrase ""Pravda, vedení se zastali redaktoři"" can be literally translated to English as ""Truth, they defended themselves editors."" However, this translation does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.

In Czech, the phrase ""védeti se"" has a connotation of being in charge or taking care of something. In this context, it means that the editors are responsible for defending the truth. The word ""redaktoři"" is also specific to Czech and refers to journalists or editorial staff.

Hint: There are several issues with the translation, but one of them is particularly important and should be addressed first.

Answer: No, the given translation is not entirely accurate. Here's why:

1. ""Original volcanic cone"" should be ""initial volcanic cone"". The word ""original"" doesn't quite fit here, as it implies that the cone has been modified or altered in some way, which isn't the case.
2. ""Subject to gradual erosion"" is a correct translation of the verb ""podléhal"", but it's not the best choice for this context. A more appropriate phrase would be ""underwent gradual erosion"". This change improves the flow and clarity of the sentence.
3. The word order in the English sentence should be reversed to match the word order in Czech. In Czech, the verb comes before the subject, so the English sentence should follow this pattern: ""Underwent gradual erosion the initial volcanic cone.""

   ""The firefighters were excellent.""
  However, this translation loses some of the nuance and context that a native speaker would understand. Here's why:

1. Word order: In Czech, the word order is different than in English. The adjective ""skvělí"" (excellent) comes before the noun it modifies (""hasiči""), whereas in English we would say ""the firefighters were excellent.""
2. Idiomatic expression: The phrase ""Hasiči byli skvělí"" is an idiomatic expression that conveys more than just a literal translation of the words. It implies that the firefighters did an outstanding job, exceeding expectations. In English, we might use the phrase ""kicked butt and took names"" to convey a similar meaning.
3. Context: The context in which the phrase is used can also affect its interpretation. For example, if someone were to say ""Hasiči byli skvělí při hašení požáru,"" (The firefighters were excellent at putting out the fire) it would convey a different meaning than just saying ""Hasiči byli sk",0.4716329405,"
   ""The firemen were very good at making sandwiches.""

What's wrong with this translation?

Hint: It has something to do with the word ""skvělí"".

Answer: In Czech, ""skvělí"" is an adjective that means ""excellent"", but it cannot be used to describe a skill or ability that someone has. Instead, it's more appropriate to use the phrase ""byli skvělé"" (they were excellent) to convey this meaning.

So, the correct translation of the Czech phrase ""Hasiči byli skvělí"" into English should be:

""The firemen were excellent.""",0.3759798512,"""The firefighters were great... but they couldn't save this burning question from being engulfed in flames.""",0.6493959343

4. ""In a situation where things are not going as planned, take the time to assess and organize your approach before moving forward.""",0.8301720365,"
   In a problematic location, it would be advisable to pay attention to order.

The following is an explanation of how this translation was arrived at:

1. V problémové lokalitě - The first word ""V"" is an abbreviation for the Czech word ""význam"", which means ""meaning"". This phrase is often used in legal documents and official letters to indicate that something is important or has a specific meaning.
2. problémy - The next two words, ""problémy"", are the plural form of the Czech word ""problem"", which refers to any difficulty or challenge that needs to be overcome. In this context, it suggests that there are multiple challenges or difficulties in the location being referred to.
3. by dohlížet na pořádek - The final phrase is a subordinate clause with two verbs: ""by"" and ""dohlížet"". ""By"" indicates purpose or intention, while ""dohlížet"" means ""to pay attention to"" or ""to take care of something"". Together, the phrase suggests that it would be advisable to pay attention to order in a problematic location.

   ""In a problematic locality, one would look at the order.""

What's wrong with this translation?

Note that I am looking for a specific error or flaw in the translation. Hint: there is more than one issue with the translation.

Answer: There are several issues with the translation:

1. Lack of idiomatic expression: The phrase ""V problémové lokalitě"" is an idiomatic expression in Czech, which means ""in a difficult situation"" or ""when things go awry."" However, the translator did not convey this nuance in their translation, making it sound more literal and wooden.
2. Incorrect word choice: The phrase ""pořádek"" in Czech can be translated to English as ""order,"" but it is also used to refer to a sequence of events or a plan. However, in the context of the original sentence, ""pořádek"" is meant to convey the idea of a difficult situation or problem, which the translator did not capture.

Another difference between the two sentences is that the adjective ""urychlená"" in Czech translates to the phrase ""urgent action"" in English. This highlights a difference in vocabulary choice and expression of meaning between the two languages.",0.7900810753,"

   Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersekova announced that Australian authorities are taking ""urgent measures"" to address the crisis caused by an aging population, higher prevalence of chronic diseases and system failures on the island.

My question is: why do we need to use the word ""is"" in the translation? The original phrase does not contain this verb. Is it necessary to add it for grammatical reasons or clarity? If so, what kind of clarity would adding the verb provide? I'm trying to understand when and how to decide whether or not to include a verb that is not present in the original sentence.

Thank you!

Answer: You raise an excellent question! In this case, including ""is"" in the translation does add some clarity, but it's not strictly necessary from a grammatical standpoint. Here are a few reasons why I chose to include it:

1. Subject-verb agreement: English typically requires a subject-verb agreement, which means that when we have a plural subject (in this case, ""Australian authorities""), we need a plural verb form (""are""). Without the word ""is,"" the sentence would sound un",0.8348982837,"

Hint: Look for words or phrases that are not needed in English but appear in Czech.

Answer: The word ""ostrova"" (island) is unnecessary in English, as Australia is a continent and does not have islands. Additionally, the phrase ""vyšším počtem chronických chorob"" (higher prevalence of chronic diseases) would be more commonly expressed as ""higher incidence of chronic diseases.""",0.795828409,"""Australian government taking 'urgent action' to address the crisis caused by an aging population, higher rates of chronic diseases and system failures.""",0.8308257634

Note that ""vláda"" in Czech means both ""government"" and ""rule"". So it's possible to interpret the sentence as either ""I negotiated with Klaus and Spidla about the government"" or ""I negotiated with Klaus and Spidla about ruling"". In English, we would use two separate words for these concepts (i.e. ""government"" and ""rule""), but in Czech they are both conveyed by a single word.",0.6570296209,"""He negotiated with Klaus and Spidla about the government.""

Hint: Consider the following aspects when evaluating the quality of the translation: accuracy, fluency, appropriateness, clarity, concision, and precision.

Answer: The masterful translator used several techniques to produce an excellent English version of the Czech phrase. Here are some specific features that make this translation stand out:

1. Accuracy: The translator accurately conveyed the meaning of the original text by using precise vocabulary and phrasing. For instance, ""Ale toto zařízení"" is translated as ""Moreover, this device,"" which perfectly captures the connection between the two clauses in the original Czech phrase.
2. Fluency: The translation reads smoothly and naturally, with a clear flow of ideas from one sentence",0.79040698,"
   And this device that is being tested, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and provides only limited information that is regularly uploaded via a modem.





Here are some possible corrections for the provided Czech translation:

1. ""And this device"" could be translated as ""This device"".
2. ""attracts the attention of road network designers"" could be translated as ""catches the eye of road network designers"" or ""draws the interest of road network designers"".
3. ""because it does not use GPS and provides only limited information"" could be translated as ""since it does not rely on GPS and offers only a restricted amount of data"".
4. ""that is regularly uploaded via a modem"" could be translated as ""which is periodically transmitted through a modem"".

How would you correct this translation to make it more accurate? Please provide an updated version of the translated phrase.

Hint: The original Czech phrase is talking about a device that doesn't use GPS, but instead uses other methods to determine its location and provides limited information about its surroundings.

Answer: Here's how you could correct the translation to make it more accurate:

How did the translator manage this feat? It is not a simple matter of using a dictionary or machine translation tools, as these methods would likely produce awkward or inaccurate results.

This translation captures the meaning of the original Czech phrase with great accuracy. However, it is important to note that there may be some nuances or cultural references in the original phrase that are not fully conveyed by the English translation. For example, the word ""chudobě"" specifically refers to financial poverty, but also has connotations of emotional or spiritual poverty.

In this revised version, the word ""smršťovat"" (to shrink) is used instead of ""ztrácí peníze"" (to lose money), which better captures the idea that the company's sales are decreasing.

Here are some explanations of the differences between the two translations:

1. The word ""poplatky"" in Czech refers specifically to taxes or fees, whereas the English translation ""fees"" is more general and could refer to any type of payment. To accurately convey the meaning of the original phrase, it would be better to use the word ""charges"" instead of ""fees"".

   Doctor Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law ""looks like a good thing.""

The word order is different between Czech and English. In Czech, the subject (Doctor Jack Drescher) comes before the verb (řekl), while in English, the subject (doctor) comes after the verb (said). Additionally, the prepositional phrase ""nový německý zákon"" in Czech is equivalent to the relative clause ""who specializes in gender identity issues"" in English.

But then the translator adds an additional word to the end of the sentence:

""...which could potentially help transgender people in Germany feel more secure and accepted in their daily lives.""

Is this addition appropriate? Why or why not?

The original Czech phrase does not explicitly state that the new German law will have any positive effects on transgender people. It only states that Dr. Drescher thinks the law is a good thing. The translator's addition of ""which could potentially help transgender people in Germany feel more secure and accepted in their daily lives"" seems to be an interpretation or speculation about the potential consequences of the new law, rather than a direct translation of the original phrase.

One argument for why this addition might be appropriate is that it provides context and background information about the issue being discussed.

In this example, we have used the phrase ""co našel"" to express that the speaker has discovered something unexpected and frightening.

""And that's how you say 'It was terrifying' in Czech! To, co našel, bylo děsivé - just remember it like this: T-O-terrorizing! Haha, get it? :D ""

The phrase provided is a correct translation of the English sentence ""It was terrifying"" into Czech. However, the way it is presented in the text with the play on words and the use of the word ""terrorizing"" to make a pun is not a formal or natural way of translating the sentence in Czech.

In a more formal or natural translation, the phrase would be translated as:

To bylo děsivé (literally ""It was frightening"") or To byla děsivá (literally ""It was terrifying"").",0.5386164448,"
   ""To what he found was dreadful.""

This translation misses several aspects of the original phrase. Can you provide a more accurate and idiomatic English translation? If so, please explain your reasoning for each aspect that was missed by the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version.

Note: Please keep in mind that the goal is to translate the sentence as accurately and naturally as possible, rather than simply replacing individual words with their direct English counterparts.
  Here are some aspects of the original phrase that were missed by the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version:
  1. The word ""co"" is a pronoun meaning ""what"", but it has a more emphatic connotation than the word ""what"". For example, you might use ""co"" to emphasize that what you are referring to is particularly important or noteworthy. In English, there isn't an exact equivalent of this nuance, but one way to capture it could be by using the phrase ""the very thing that..."", as in: ""The very thing that he found was dreadful.""
  2. The word ""našel"" is the past tense of the verb """,0.5181160981,"""What I found was terrifying...""

   Explained that studying how real dogs react to real dogs could be helpful.",0.9525069345,"
   He explained that a study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful.
   
  But then he gets carried away and adds some flourishes of his own,
  turning an already excellent translation into something truly exceptional:
   He expounded at length on the potential benefits of such research,
     emphasizing that a better understanding of canine behavior would have far-reaching implications for pet owners, trainers, and even scientists.
      His passion for the subject was evident in every word, as he wove together a tapestry of knowledge and insight that left me both educated and inspired.",0.7541891108,"
   ""He explained that a study on how real dogs react to real dogs could be helpful.""

Now, here's the catch. What if we wanted to translate this sentence back into Czech?
  How would we express the same idea using different words and phrasing?

One possible way to do so is:
   ""Explained that a study on how real dogs respond to genuine canines could be beneficial.""

In this version, we've replaced ""react"" with ""respond,"" which carries a slightly different connotation. Additionally, we've changed ""real dogs"" to ""genuine canines,"" which is more idiomatic in Czech.

So there you have it! Two ways to express the same idea in English and Czech, each with its own nuances and flavors.",0.7828678744,"
   He explained that this study could help understand how real dogs react to real dogs.

The correct translation of the original Czech sentence is:
   He explained that this study could help us understand how dogs react to real dogs.

What was done incorrectly in the incompetent masterful translator's version?  Please select all that apply.

A) The word ""real"" was needlessly repeated twice.
B) The word ""psy"" (Czech for ""dogs"") was mistranslated as ""real dogs"".
C) The sentence structure and grammar were incorrect.
D) The phrase ""studie o tom, jak psi reagují na skutečné psy"" should have been translated more literally as ""a study about how dogs react to real dogs.""",0.7741352872,"""The study could help explain how real dogs react to other real dogs.""",0.9157323887

Jack Valero from the list of Catholic Voices said that the number of electing cardinals until February is likely to decrease.

However, there are a few minor issues with the translation:

1. ""volících"" should be translated as ""electing"" rather than ""volicing"".
2. The phrase ""do února"" could be more accurately rendered as ""until February"".
3. The word order in the original Czech sentence is slightly different from the English translation, which can affect the overall flow of the sentence.
4. The phrase ""Catholic Voices"" should be translated as a proper noun to indicate that it is an organization with a specific name.

   The scope and technical capabilities of American espionage agencies revealed by Snowden are shocking to some companies that previously believed China posed the greatest threat.

In this sentence, ""šokující"" is used to describe something that is surprising or unexpected, but not necessarily negative. In contrast, ""shocking"" in English often carries a more negative connotation, implying something that is disturbing or alarming. To convey the same sense of surprise without the negative undertone, you could use the phrase ""unexpectedly extensive"" to describe the scope of the American espionage agencies. For example:

Czech: Rozsah amerických špionážních agentur odhalený Snowdenem je neočekávajícíně rozsáhlý.
  ",0.900514115,"
   The scope and technical sophistication of American espionage agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies that previously thought that China posed the greatest threat to their privacy.

The Czech phrase contains several challenges for a high-quality translation, including:
 1. Technical vocabulary: The original text includes the term ""špionážní agentury,"" which is specific to the context of espionage and intelligence agencies. A translator must be familiar with this terminology to convey its meaning accurately.
2. Idiomatic expressions: The phrase ""odhalený Snowdenem"" (revealed by Snowden) is an idiomatic expression that requires a nuanced understanding of the context in which it is used. A skilled translator will recognize this and translate it appropriately to convey its intended meaning.
3. Cultural references: The phrase ""pro některé společnosti,"" or ""for some companies,"" assumes a certain level of cultural knowledge about the target audience's familiarity with American espionage agencies and their perceived threats to privacy.

My attempt at a more idiomatic translation:
  The staggering extent and sophisticated technology employed by US spy agencies, as revealed by Snowden, have left many firms reeling - they had previously believed that China was their biggest surveillance concern.

Can you tell me what I did right and wrong in my attempt at a more idiomatic translation? And how would you suggest I improve it further?

Your attempt at a more idiomatic translation is generally good, but there are a few areas that could be improved upon. Here are some suggestions:

1.

""He speaks too little about music, yet his overall approach to life is closely connected with it.""

The translation captures the meaning of the original phrase and conveys it in a way that is natural and idiomatic in English.

Best regards,

   Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as a feasible path to world-class races.

How did the translator do? Let's break it down:

1. Form: The sentence structure of the original Czech phrase (Ne všichni jsou zkušenými závodníky, ale jsou to lidé... ) is maintained in the translation (Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as a feasible path to world-class races.)
2. Meaning: The translator accurately conveys the meaning of the original phrase, which emphasizes that not everyone is an experienced race car driver, but these people still seek excitement, adventure, and a realistic opportunity to participate in high-level races.
3. Vocabulary: The translator uses appropriate vocabulary for each language. For example, ""zkušenými závodníky"" (experienced racers) is translated as ""racer"" in English, which accurately conveys the meaning of the original phrase. Additionally, ""vzrušení",0.7878612006,"
   Not all are experienced racers, but they're people who want excitement and adventure as well as a feasible path to world-class races.

What is wrong with this translation? Can you suggest an improved version of the translation?

Hint: Look closely at the word order in the original Czech phrase and how it conveys meaning differently than the English translation.

Answer: The main issue with the translation is that it does not accurately convey the word order and structure of the original Czech phrase, which affects the overall meaning and flow of the sentence. Here's an improved version of the translation:

Ne všichni jsou zkušenými závodníky, ale to jsou lidé, kteří chtějí vzrušení a dobrodružství a také dostupnou cestu k závodům světové třídy.

In this version, the word order is more closely matched to the original Czech phrase, with ""to jsou lidé"" (those are people) coming before ""ctějí vzrušení"" (want excitement), which better conveys the idea that the people in question are not",0.7368638322,"Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as a feasible path to world-class racing.",0.9234715504

   I'm in the phase where I go day by day.",0.7798999894,"
  
I am in a phase where I'm losing my mind day by day.

The phrase ""ve fázi"" is often used to describe a period of time when someone or something is going through some kind of process, and it can be translated as ""in a phase"". However, the word ""fáze"" also has other meanings in Czech, such as ""phase"" (as in a stage in a project) or ""period"" (as in a specific time frame).

In this case, the phrase ""ve fázi"" is used to describe a state of mind where someone is losing their mental faculties day by day. The word ""fáze"" has a connotation of something that is ongoing and progressive, which fits well with the idea of someone's cognitive abilities deteriorating over time.

The translation into English captures this meaning nicely, using the phrase ""I am in a phase where I'm losing my mind day by day"" to convey the idea that the speaker is going through a process of declining mental health. The use of the word ""phase"" instead of ""stage"" or ""period"" also helps to emphasize the ongoing nature of this process",0.3524474144,"

The translation is spot-on, capturing the essence of the original Czech phrase and conveying it accurately in English. The use of phrases like ""sledovacích kamer"" (surveillance cameras) and ""vyšetřovatelé"" (investigators) adds a level of specificity and detail that is lost in translation, but the overall meaning of the sentence remains clear and understandable to English speakers.

Overall, this translation demonstrates the skill and expertise of a masterful Czech translator who can accurately convey complex legal concepts and terminology from one language to another with precision and clarity.",0.6169142344,"
   ""The judge from southern Georgia in the middle of the week ordered the authorities to provide all videos from surveillance cameras that the investigators reviewed.""

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

* Soudce (judge) is translated as ""judge""
* z jižní Georgie (from southern Georgia) is translated as ""from southern Georgia""
* ve středu úřadům (in the middle of the week) is translated as ""in the middle of the week""
* nařídil (ordered) is translated as ""ordered""
* aby daly k dispozici (to provide) is translated as ""to provide""
* všechna videa (all videos) is translated as ""all videos""
* ze sledovacích kamer (from surveillance cameras) is translated as ""from surveillance cameras""

   ""The judge from southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that all videos from surveillance cameras be made available to the authorities, which were reviewed by investigators.""

This is a good example of how a translation can go wrong. The original sentence in Czech has several specific features that are not present in the English translation:

1. Soudce (judge) is a formal term that is used in legal contexts and carries a certain level of authority. In the English translation, ""judge"" is used, but it does not convey the same level of formality as the original Czech phrase.
2. Ve středu úřadům (on Wednesday at the authorities) - This phrase emphasizes the timing and location of the judge's order. In the English translation, this information is missing.
3. Nařídil (ordered) - This verb conveys a sense of authority and urgency that is lost in the English translation.

  * The word ""sešli"" in Czech roughly translates to ""met with"", but it implies a more casual or informal gathering than a formal meeting. In English, we might use the phrase ""got together with"" to convey this same sense of an informal get-together.
  * The word ""skříňky"" in Czech is difficult to translate directly into English because it refers to a specific type of small box or container.

   ""Pro Bwell's constant refusal is not a burden.""

This phrase uses the word ""břemen"" which means burden, but in this context it is used to convey that Pro Bwell's refusal is not something that should be seen as a negative or heavy thing. Instead, it is more of an empowering statement where Pro Bwell is taking control and making choices for themselves.",0.6762080916,"

The correct answer is below, but first here are some possible mistakes and their explanations:

A) Pro Bwelleho neustálý zápřah není břemenem. (This is the correct translation.)
B) For Bell's continuous damper is not a hindrance. (Missing word ""damping"" in the original phrase.)
C) For Bell's damping is not a hindrance continuously. (Incorrect word order and incorrect use of adverb ""continuously"".)
D) For Bell's continuous damping is not an obstacle. (Missing word ""hindrance"" in the original phrase.)
E) Pro Bwelleho neustálý zápřah není překážkou. (This translation is incorrect because it uses the word ""prekážka"" which means ""obstacle"", but the original phrase uses ""zápřah"" which specifically means ""hindrance"".)

Both translations are not perfect, but they convey the same information. Here's a breakdown of each phrase:

Incorrect translation: ""The profit of the airplane industry decreased by 13% to 2 billion USD.""

This translation is incorrect because it uses the word ""profit"" instead of ""revenue"". The original Czech phrase refers to the revenue of the airplane industry, not its profit. Additionally, the phrase should be translated as ""decreased by X%"", not ""decreased to Y"".

Correct translation: ""Revenue in the airplane industry decreased by 13% to 2 billion USD.""

This translation is more accurate because it uses the word ""revenue"" instead of ""profit"", and it correctly conveys that the revenue decreased by 13%. Additionally, the phrase ""to 2 billion USD"" is correct because it indicates the total amount of revenue lost.

In this sentence, ""předloni"" (meaning ""before last month"") is used to compare the current month with the previous one, emphasizing that there was a decrease in visitors.
  
The word ""počet"" means ""number"", and ""poklesl"" is the verb form meaning ""decreased"". So the whole sentence can be translated as: The number of visitors decreased to 153 last month, but it was a record-breaking month.",0.8305280387,"

Certainly! Here's a more detailed English translation of the given Czech sentence:

Writer Václav Kahuda has resumed writing after an extended twelve-year break, marking a triumphant return to his craft.

This phrase captures some of the nuances and shades of meaning conveyed in the original Czech sentence, such as:

1. The idea of returning or coming back (Václav Kahuda se vrátil k psaní)
2. The length of time since the return (dvanáct let - twelve years)
3. The significance of the return (marking a triumphant return to his craft)
4. The use of the word ""vrátil"" which implies a more deliberate and conscious decision to come back, rather than simply happening upon it.

By including these nuances",0.7311741065,"
   Writer Vaclav Kahuda has returned to writing after twelve years.

The correct translation of the phrase is:

This is one possible interpretation of the sentence, but there are other ways to understand it as well. For example, instead of ""pevného internetu"" (fixed-line internet), the phrase could also be interpreted as referring to ""kabelové televize"" (cable television).

  Here are some possible ways to express the same idea in English, using different words and phrases:

* He justified his delay by citing the forthcoming New State Energy Concept and the government's agreement on contract variations.
* The reason for his hesitation was that he was waiting for the new State Energy Policy and the government's endorsement of the contract differences.
* His explanation for not acting sooner was that he had to wait for the next iteration of the State Energy Plan and get approval from the authorities on the terms of the contract.

  In all three examples, the general idea is conveyed: the speaker or writer is explaining why they cannot act immediately by citing external factors (the forthcoming New State Energy Concept) and internal ones (government approval).",0.8352285481,"
   ""Justified by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and government approval of contracts for differences.""

The word ""čekáním"" is a noun, which can be translated as ""waiting"". However, in this context it seems to have the connotation of ""justifying"" or ""excusing"" one's actions. The phrase ""odsouhlasením Contracts of difference"" refers to the approval of contracts that differ from the standard terms and conditions.

The overall meaning of the sentence is that the speaker is justifying their decision to wait for the new State Energy Concept and government approval before taking action, as this will allow them to ensure that they are following the correct procedures and guidelines.",0.8403847281,"

My answer:

955,"To, co udělali, bylo velmi odvážné.",It was really daring what they did.,"

The word ""odvažný"" in the original sentence is an adjective meaning ""brave"". The word ""to"" in the translation is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context.",0.5584080444,"
   What they did was very brave.

But there's a problem! This translation doesn't quite capture the full flavor of the original Czech phrase. Why? Because in Czech, words often have connotations and nuances that don't necessarily translate directly to other languages. For example, the word ""odvážné"" can also imply a sense of recklessness or impulsiveness, which isn't fully conveyed by the English word ""brave.""
   Sure, you could try using a different word like ""daring"" or ""audacious,"" but even those words don't quite capture the same shade of meaning as the original Czech phrase. And that's just one example! In any case, it's clear that translating between languages can be tricky and requires a deep understanding of both cultures involved.
  Therefore, when communicating with someone who speaks another language, it's important to keep in mind that words may not always translate directly and that nuances can get lost in translation. It's better to rely on context clues or ask for clarification if you don't understand something rather than making assumptions based solely on a literal translation.

  QUESTION: Is this a correct translation of the original Czech phrase? If not, what 
     would be an appropriate correction or alternative translation? Please provide 
     any relevant context or explanations that might help to clarify the issue.

The provided English translation is incorrect because it does not convey the same level of admiration and praise as the original Czech phrase. Here's a more appropriate translation:

To, co udělali, bylo velmi statečné.

In this context, ""statečné"" better captures the sense of bravery and heroism implied by the original Czech phrase. The word ""statečné"" emphasizes the courageous act performed by ""to,"" which is not fully conveyed by the English translation ""what they did was very brave.""

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the phrase ""velmi odvážné"" can be translated as ""very bold"" or ""highly daring,"" so another possible alternative translation could be:

To, co udělali, bylo velmi odvážné.

In this case, the focus is more on the",0.5051166963,"
   It was very brave of them to do what they did.

The correct translation should be more like:
   What they did was very bold or daring.

Can you suggest a better English translation for this phrase?
```
To, co udělali, bylo velmi odvážné.
```
One possible way to translate the phrase ""velmi odvažne"" is as follows: 

What they did was exceedingly bold or daring.

Another option could be:

Their action was incredibly audacious or intrepid.

Additionally, you might also consider using the word ""dauntless"" to convey the sense of fearlessness and audacity that is implied in the original phrase. For example: 

What they did was truly dauntless.

In any case, it's important to keep in mind that translating idiomatic expressions can be a complex task, as words or phrases may have different connotations or nuances depending on the language and culture. Therefore, it's always helpful to consult with multiple sources or native speakers before finalizing a translation.",0.683668601,"They did something very bold...

   However Anne Tamar-Mattisová, the director of Advocates for Informed Choice (a legal group) based in California, fears that the German law ""calls for shaming and stigma.""

In this sentence, the word ""however"" is used to contrast the previous statement with a new one. The phrase ""Avšak Anne Tamar-Mattisová"" is the subject of the second part of the sentence, and ""se obává"" is in the third person singular form because it refers to Anne Tamar-Mattisová.

The word ""čajchování"" (cejchování) is a Czech word that means ""shaming"" or ""stigmatizing"", so the phrase ""vyzývá k cejchování"" can be translated as ""calls for shaming"". The word order in this sentence is also worth noting, as the verb ""se obáva"" (fears) comes before the object of the sentence, which is a common word order in Czech.",0.9131560571,"

In this example, the translator has skillfully conveyed the meaning of the original Czech phrase into English. Here are some key aspects of their translation:
  1. Word-for-word translation: The translator has remained faithful to the wording of the original Czech phrase, using exact equivalents in English where possible. For example, ""ředitelka právní skupiny"" becomes ""director of legal group,"" and ""zastánci informované volby"" becomes ""supporters of informed decision.""
  2. Grammar: The translator has maintained the grammatical structure of the original phrase, using a similar sentence pattern in English. For example, both phrases begin with a subject (Anne Tamar-Mattisová) and use a subordinate clause to provide more information about her fears.
  3. Idiomatic expression: The translator has used idiomatic expressions that convey the same meaning as the original Czech phrase",0.7721888057,"
   However Anne Tamar-Mattisová, director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice (Supporters of Informed Decision) with a seat in California, fears that the German law ""incites ostracism and stigmatization"".

  - Translated ""právní skupina"" as ""legal group"", since it is a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the phrase in English.
  - Used ""zastánci informované volby"" instead of ""informed choice"" to better convey the idea that this is an organization that supports informed decision-making.
  - Translated ""cejchování"" as ""ostracism"", since it is a more common term in English for the concept of shunning or excluding someone from society.

How does this translation differ from the original phrase?  What are some key differences that you notice between the two phrases?  

The provided English translation is very good, but there are several minor issues. Here's how it differs from the original Czech phrase:

1. Word order: The English sentence has a more natural word order than the Czech one. In Czech, the verb ""získal"" (acquired) comes before the object ""O2 Czech and Slovak"", while in English, the word order is reversed to place the object first.
2. Prepositions: The Czech phrase uses prepositions ""se"" (with) and ""od"" (from), which are not necessary in English. Instead, the English translation uses phrases like ""by Ten"" and ""of the Czech one"".
3. Article usage: In Czech, the article ""the"" is used before ""O2 Czech and Slovak"", while in English, it",0.8051626773,"

There are several issues with the incompetent masterful Czech translator's translation:

1. Linguistic accuracy: The translator has made some grammatical errors, such as using ""okamžitě"" instead of ""immediately"" and ""se stále slušnými zisky"" instead of ""with still respectable profits.""
2. Idiomatic expression: The phrase ""plnohodnotného operátora"" is not an idiomatic expression in English, and it does not convey the same meaning as the original Czech phrase. A better translation would be ""full-fledged operator.""

Please provide an explanation for why your translation was incompetent and how you would improve it to make it more accurate.

My response:

Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to reflect on my previous translation of the Czech phrase into English. Upon further consideration, I realize that my translation was inaccurate because I misunderstood the meaning of the verb ""venčit"" and its correct usage in this context. In Czech, ""venčit"" means ""to whip,"" not ""to beat."" Therefore, a more accurate translation would be:

Three days later, a man saw the imprisoned one being whipped by a dog.

To improve my translation, I will make sure to consult reliable dictionaries and grammar resources to ensure that I accurately understand the meaning of Czech words and phrases before attempting to translate them into English. Additionally, I will pay closer attention to verb conjugation and word order in the source language to better capture the intended meaning of the",0.5530530716,"Three days later, a man who had been trapped in the quarry saw a dog that was barking.",0.8305407025

  However, upon closer inspection, there is a small problem with the translation. The word ""degrade"" in English does not quite convey the same meaning as the original Czech phrase. In Czech, the verb ""vykovávat"" has a more nuanced connotation of downgrading or demoting someone from a higher position to a lower one. 
  
  To accurately capture this subtle difference in meaning, the translator might consider using the word ""demote"" instead of ""degrade"". This would result in a more faithful translation of the original Czech phrase into ",0.6980865452,"
   Do you want to join the ranks of CSSD district leaders who hold both the office of representative and that of mayor at the same time, just like them, degrading both professions?

The word ""hejtman"" is used in the original Czech text. This term can be translated into English as ""mayor"". However, it's important to note that the word ""hejtman"" has a more specific meaning in Czech than the word ""mayor"" does in English. In particular, the word ""hejtman"" is typically used to refer to the mayor of a district or a small town, whereas the word ""mayor"" can be used to refer to the head of any type of municipality, no matter how large or small.

In this context, it would be more appropriate to use the word ""district leader"" instead of ""hejtman"", as the original text is referring to leaders who hold both positions in a district. Additionally, using the phrase ""degrading both professions"" may not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original Czech sentence, which suggests that holding both positions at once can lead to a devaluation or downplaying of either position individually. A more appropriate translation might be",0.7264672532,"

The masterful Czech-to-English translation captures the meaning of the original phrase with remarkable accuracy and fluency. Here is an explanation of how each part of the English sentence corresponds to its counterpart in the Czech original:
  1. ""Říká"" (it is said) matches the Czech word order, where the verb comes at the end of the sentence. In English, we would say ""It is said that..."".
  2. ""že když byla Lenka malá"" (when Lenka was little) corresponds to the English phrase ""when she was little"", with the past tense ""was"" matching the Czech perfective aspect of the verb ""byla"".
  3. ""narvala štrůdl do videa"" (put her fingers in her ears) is a literal translation of the Czech idiomatic expression, which can be rendered into English as ""put her fingers in her ears"".

   It is said that when Lenka was little, she would watch cooking videos and think that someone was playing a recipe for her, so she still can't make it today.

The translation captures all of the crucial elements of the original Czech phrase, including the childlike misconception about watching videos (“narvala štrůdl do videa”), the idea that Lenka thought someone was playing a recipe for her (“myslela si, že ji přehraje recept”), and the humorous result of Lenka still being unable to make the dish today (“ proto ho dodnes neumí upéct”).

I will be happy to accept answers from anyone who knows Czech - I am just looking for a more natural-sounding English version of the phrase!

Here's what I think is wrong with the existing translation:

1. ""Říká"" should probably be translated as ""it is said"" or ""people say"", rather than simply ""say"".   This makes the sentence sound less like a direct quote and more like general knowledge.
2. ""štrůdl"" is an old-fashioned word for ""recipe"", so it might not be familiar to all English speakers.  A better choice might be ""video game"" or just ""game"".   This will also make the sentence sound less archaic and more relatable to modern listeners.
3. ""nepřehrál"" is a bit of an awkward word to translate directly, but it",0.7399197371,"""According to Lenka, when she was little, she used to watch videos and think that the recipe was being played back, so she still can't make it today.""",0.8404490483

   I predict that Scotland would do well in a loosely organized Europe if it retained its own currency.

The word order is different in Czech and English, but the meaning of the sentence is similar. In both languages, the subject (Scotland) is followed by a verb (would/do well), which is modified by an adverbial phrase beginning with ""if"" that describes a hypothetical situation (retaining its own currency). The word order in Czech is Subject-Verb-Object, while the word order in English is Verb-Subject-Object.

In terms of vocabulary, there are some differences between the two languages. The Czech word ""předpokládám"" is a verb that means ""to predict,"" while the English word ""predict"" is used as a verb here. Additionally, the phrase ""uvolněném uspořádaní Evropy"" in Czech translates to ""loosely organized Europe"" in English.

Overall, both sentences convey similar meanings and are grammatically correct in their respective languages.",0.7562261908,"
   I suppose that Scotland would do well in a more relaxed setup of Europe if it managed to keep its own currency.

The question is, why did the translator choose ""suppose"" instead of ""assume""? Is there any difference between these two words? And what's the nuance behind using ""I suppose"" vs. ""I assume""?
\end{blockquote}

Yes, there is a subtle difference between ""suppose"" and ""assume"". Both words can be used to express an opinion or belief about something that may not necessarily be true or proven, but they have slightly different connotations:

* ""Assume"" implies a greater degree of certainty or confidence in the statement being made. For example, ""I assume that Scotland will do well if it keeps its own currency"" suggests that the speaker is fairly confident about this outcome based on their understanding of the situation.
* ""Suppose"", on the other hand, implies a more tentative or speculative attitude towards the statement being made. It acknowledges that there may be some uncertainty or doubt involved, and expresses only a possibility rather than a certainty. For example, ""I suppose that Scotland might do well if it keeps its own",0.8007186482,"
   I assume that Scotland would do well in a loosely organized Europe if it retained its own currency.

   The minimum wage was more than three times lower then and my parents were able to live off it with no lack of anything.

In this sentence, the speaker is comparing the current minimum wage (which they believe is too high) to what it used to be in the past (when their parents were working). They are saying that the old minimum wage was lower than the current one, but their parents were able to live comfortably on it without any lack of necessities.

This sentence is using the word ""nižší"" which means ""lower"". The phrase ""třikrát nižší"" can be translated as ""more than three times lower"", so in this case, the minimum wage was more than three times lower in the past than it is now.",0.9042078809,"
  
Minimum wage was more than three times lower then and my parents managed to live on it without us lacking anything.

When I was growing up, minimum wage was much lower than it is now, and my parents were able to provide for us without any difficulties.

In this version, we used ""growing up"" instead of ""then,"" which is an idiomatic expression that implies a period of time in the past.

   In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with devices, drivers were concerned that the government was capable of tracking every one of their movements.

In this sentence, ""vláda"" (government) is a noun phrase in Czech, and it is being modified by an adjective ""schopná"" (capable). The word order in Czech is Subject-Object-Verb, so the adjective comes after the noun it modifies.

In English, we would typically use the preposition ""of"" to indicate that the government is capable of tracking every one of their movements. So the sentence structure and word order are different between Czech and English.",0.8592332706,"
   In Nevada, where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with devices, drivers were concerned that the government was capable of monitoring their every move.

The word ""byli"" is the third person plural form of the verb ""být"" (to be), and ""řidiči"" is the masculine noun for ""drivers"". The phrase ""znepokojení tím, že"" can be translated to ""concerned that"", and ""vláda"" means ""government"". Finally, ""je schopná sledovat každý jejich pohyb"" can be translated to ""is capable of monitoring their every move"".

The English translation accurately conveys this meaning while maintaining a natural flow and structure.",0.867031527,"
   In Nevada, where around 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track every move they made.

The first thing to note is that ""V Nevadě"" means ""In Nevada"", so the translator has correctly captured the location aspect of the phrase. The word ""kde"" in Czech can be translated as ""where"" or ""in which place"".

The second point to note is that the translator has correctly conveyed the idea that the drivers were concerned about being tracked by the government. In this regard, they have used the verb ""were concerned"" to capture the sentiment of the original phrase, where the word ""byli znepokojení"" conveys a sense of worry or unease.

The third point is that the translator has accurately translated the phrase ""zařízením vybaveno"" as ""equipped with devices"". The word ""zařízením"" in Czech can be translated as ""with equipment"" or ""by means of equipment"", and the translator has chosen the most appropriate term to convey this idea.

Finally, the translator has accurately captured the number of cars",0.8498147391,"
   In Nevada, where there has been recently equipped with about 50 cars for volunteers, the drivers were worried that the government is capable of tracking every one of their movements.

   During the years that the government initiated discussions in 2005, it put pressure on...
1. Verb tense consistency: The verb ""put pressure on"" is in the present perfect tense, but the subject ""vláda"" (government) is in the singular form, which suggests a past action.

What is wrong with this translation? Can you suggest a better one?

Hint: pay attention to word order, idiomatic expressions and verb tenses.

Answer: There are several issues with the given translation:

1. Word order: The original phrase has a more natural word order, with ""spát ve dne"" (sleep during the day) coming before ""zpívat po nocích"" (sing at nights). In the translation, these two phrases are reversed, which makes it sound less idiomatic.
2. Idiomatic expressions: The phrase ""spát ve dne"" is an idiomatic expression that means to sleep during the daytime, not just to take a nap or rest. Similarly, ""zpívat po nocích"" means to sing at night, not just to perform music in the evening. The translation should preserve these idiomatic expressions.
3. Verb tenses: The original phrase uses the present tense (""prý"") to indicate that something is true or habitual. In the translation,",0.8878388991,"""Andrej Ruml sang from this box quite appropriately 'Sleep During the Day' and played guitar to accompany him at night.""

Yes, you are correct! The correct translation of ""Ale hokej mi na oplátku nabídl spoustu možností a tohle je jedna z nich"" would be:

And he offered me plenty of options/choices, and this one is one of them.

The incompetent masterful translator's version has a few issues:

1. ""spoustu možností"" should be translated as ""plenty of options"" or ""plenty of choices"", not ""possibilities"".
2. ""na oplátku"" is not necessary in the English translation, and it can make the sentence sound a bit awkward.

   During the era of President Zeman, there entered a legendary scene with a popcorn seller, and it's not difficult to listen to the complaints that are being gathered by the castle guards.

In this sentence, ""éry"" is an adjective used to describe the period of time during which President Zeman was in office. The word ""popelníček"" refers to a popcorn seller, and ""hradní družina"" means ""castle guard."" The phrase ""stížnosti"" can be translated as ""complaints,"" and ""doklady"" means ""documents.""

Overall, this sentence is describing a situation where the castle guards are collecting complaints about something that happened during President Zeman's era. The use of the word ""legendary"" to describe the scene suggests that it was an unusual or notable event.",0.7463584638,"
   The president's entry into office with a popelník (an old-fashioned term for an umbrella) has provided a legendary scene, and it is not difficult to listen to the complaints of the castle's retinue.

But what does this phrase actually mean?  And why is there a need for translation in the first place?

The original Czech phrase contains several idiomatic expressions that may be unfamiliar to English speakers, and it also employs wordplay involving the multiple meanings of ""popelník."" Here's a breakdown of each element:

1. Do éry prezidenta Zemana - This phrase means ""during President Zeman's era"" or ""in the time of President Zeman.""
2. vkročila legendární scénou - The word ""vkročila"" is a feminine noun meaning ""entry,"" and ""legendární"" means ""legendary"" or ""mythical."" So this phrase can be translated as ""legendary entry"" or ""mythical beginning.""
3. s popelníčkem - The word ""popelník"" is an old-",0.7664133444,"
   ""The president's scandal involving a popcorn-like substance has entered legendary status, making it easy to believe allegations of mistreatment by castle staff.""

My question is: what does ""popelníček"" mean in Czech? And how did the translator manage to convey its meaning so accurately into English with just one word - ""popcorn-like""?
\end{blockquote}

""Popelníček"" is a Czech word that refers to a type of powder or substance that resembles popcorn. In the context of the phrase provided, it likely means a light, fluffy, and perhaps even sweet-tasting substance.

The translator conveyed the meaning of ""popelníček"" into English with the word ""popcorn-like"" because both words share similar connotations of being light, airy, and having a distinct texture or appearance. While ""popelníček"" is not exactly the same as popcorn, it has enough similarities that the translator was able to use ""popcorn-like"" as a fitting equivalent in English. Additionally, using a single word like",0.6471041178,"
   As president Zeman's era entered a legendary scene with a popcorn maker, it is not difficult to listen to the complaints of the castle staff.

Yes, I can spot the differences. Here they are:

1. The original Czech phrase uses ""utajovaná lánská schůzka"" (secret meeting of part of the party leadership), while the incompetent masterful translation uses ""part of the party leadership"" instead of ""lanská schůzka"".

   In June, the government significantly revised upwards its estimates for the costs of constructing the high-speed line between London and northern England, from £32.7 billion to a staggering £42.6 billion. 
   The Czech phrase ""odhadované náklady"" can be translated as ""estimated costs"", but it also implies that these are not final or set in stone, so the word ""reassessed"" is used instead of simply ""estimated"". Additionally, the word ""significantly"" is added to emphasize the magnitude of the increase. Finally, the phrase ""staggering £42.6 billion"" is used to convey the shocking nature of the new estimate.",0.8378503958,"
   In June, the government reassessed the estimated costs of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.

The difference in wording is subtle but significant. The Czech original uses the verb ""přehodnotit"" which specifically means ""to reassess"", while the English translation uses ""reassessed"". This changes the connotation of the phrase slightly, as ""reassessed"" implies a more thorough and perhaps even critical evaluation of the costs, whereas ""přehodnotit"" might convey a more casual or routine assessment.
  Additionally, the Czech original uses the word ""vysokorychlostní linka"", which is a compound noun specifically meaning ""high-speed line"". The English translation uses the phrase ""high-speed line"", which is a bit less formal and might be more commonly used in everyday conversation.

The translation is correct and idiomatic, but it doesn't quite capture the nuance of the original Czech phrase. Here's a more detailed explanation of what's going on:

In Czech, ""opravdu"" is an intensifier that emphasizes the speaker's strong belief or conviction. It can be translated as ""really"" or ""truly"", but it carries a stronger connotation than just those words alone.

The phrase ""si myslím"" is another way of saying ""I think"" in Czech, and ""by měl jít"" is an idiomatic expression that means ""he should go"". However, the word ""jít"" here has a slightly different connotation than just ""go"". It implies movement towards something or someone, but also with the idea of following in their footsteps.

In Czech, the words ""nebylo ono komando nasazeno"" come before the verb ""blamuje,"" whereas in English, they come after the verb. To maintain a similar word order in both languages, it would be better to place ""unofficially"" after the verb ""was not deployed.""
  2. The phrase ""celé a že se prostě váhalo co dělat"" is quite long and could be split into two separate clauses for easier comprehension. For example: ""and everything was just hesitating about what to do.""
  3. The word ""fakt"" in Czech can be translated as ""the fact that,"" but it's not necessary in this context, as the sentence already conveys the idea of a criticism or blame. Therefore, it would be better to omit it altogether.

Obamova administrativa je kritizována za to, že nebylo její komando nasazeno oficiálně během útoku a protože se prostě váhalo co dělat.
2. Free translation:
Obamaova administratura byla kritizována pro to, že nepoužila své velení při útoku a ona se jen zastavovala s tím, co by udělala.
3. Formal equivalence translation:
Obamova administrativa je kritizována z důvodu toho, že nebylo její komando nasazeno oficiálně během útoku a protože se prostě váhalo co dělat.
4. Dynamic equivalence translation:

   ""The Obama administration is to blame for the fact that during that attack, no official command was given and everything just froze.""

Is this translation accurate? If not, what would be a more appropriate way to translate it?

(Note: The original Czech sentence uses the word ""blamuje"" which can be translated as either ""to blame"" or ""to criticize"", so I've used both options in my question)

The question is about the use of ""It's"" in the translation. In Czech, the original phrase does not contain any contraction like ""it's"". Should the translator have used a more formal version without ""it's""? Or did they choose to keep the informal tone and use the contraction for better flow?

Can you explain why your answer differs from the one provided by the incompetent masterful Czech translator? And also provide some additional tips for translating idiomatic expressions like this one? 

Thank you!

(I apologize if my question seems too simplistic, but I'm still learning and trying to understand how to translate these kinds of phrases)

Answer: The difference between the two translations lies in the level of detail and specificity used in each version. The incompetent masterful Czech translator provides a more detailed and literal translation, while my answer offers a more concise and idiomatic one. Here are some tips for translating idiomatic expressions like this:

1. Understand the nuance of the original phrase: Before you start translating, make sure you understand the connotations and implications of the original phrase in Czech.",0.7597005868,It's like the country is sick and people feel that something isn't quite right within it.,0.8950320325
487,"Demonstrant Omar Sultuane říká, že lidé jen chtějí stabilitu.","Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.","
   Protester Omar Sultuane says that people just want stability.

The word ""stability"" is used in the source text as a noun, and it refers to a state of being stable or unchanging. In this context, the protester is saying that people are seeking a sense of stability in their lives, perhaps in response to the ongoing political turmoil in the country.

The word ""stability"" can be used as both a noun and an adjective in English. As an adjective, it might describe something that is stable or unchanging, such as a stable government or economy. As a noun, it refers to the state of being stable or unchanging, as described above.

In this case, ""stability"" is used as a noun, and it is the central idea of the sentence. The protester is saying that people are seeking stability in their lives, which suggests that they want a sense of security and predictability in the face of ongoing political uncertainty.",0.7672564756,"
   Protester Omar Sultani says that people just want stability.

This is a good translation, but it does not convey the nuance of the original Czech phrase. In particular, the word ""stabilitu"" has connotations of both stability and stagnation, which are not fully captured by the English word ""stability."" Additionally, the use of the word ""říká"" (he says) in the Czech sentence adds a sense of direct quotation or emphasis that is lost in the English translation.

Here's an alternative translation that better conveys the nuance of the original phrase:
   Protester Omar Sultani claims that people yearn for stagnant stability, hinting at a desire for predictability and security rather than progress or change.

This revised translation captures the double meaning of ""stabilitu"" (stability and stagnation) by using the word ""stagnant,"" which implies a lack of movement or progress, as well as the idea that people are seeking predictability and security. Additionally, it maintains the sense of direct quotation provided by ""říká"" in the original sentence.",0.5858190385,"
   ""Omar Sulatan says that people only want stability.""

What this actually means is that in Czech, there are many words that have multiple meanings and can be used as different parts of speech. For example, the word "" říká"" (says) can also mean ""to speak"", and ""stabilitu"" can mean both ""stability"" and ""a state"".

So, a more accurate translation would be:
   Omar Sulatan says that people only want to speak of stability.
  or
   Omar Sulatan says that people are speaking of stability.",0.5496446898,"
   ""Omar Sultuane demonstrating that people only want stability.""

Correct translation is: Omar Sultani says that people just want stability. (Note: ""Sultanu"" is a misspelling of ""Sultáni"", which is the correct form in Czech.)",0.6398335416,"""People just want stability,"" says protester Omar Sultuane.

2722,"Někdy cítím, jak mi z života na téhle planetě hoří mozek.",Sometimes I feel my brain is on fire from life on this planet.,"
   Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning from the life on this planet.

This phrase is a metaphorical expression of feeling overwhelmed or burnt out by the demands and challenges of everyday life. The word ""hořet"" in Czech means ""to burn"", and it is often used to describe intense emotions such as frustration, anger, or exhaustion. In this context, the speaker is using the metaphor of a burning brain to convey their feeling of being overwhelmed by the demands of life on Earth.",0.7361948805,"
   Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning from life on this planet.

This is a good example of how a skilled translator can capture the essence and nuance of one language in another, even when idiomatic expressions or colloquialisms are involved. The phrase ""hoří mozek"" (my brain is burning) is an interesting choice that conveys a sense of intense emotional turmoil, which is effectively conveyed by the English translation ""Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning from life on this planet.""

My question to you is, how would you translate it? Would you agree with the provided translation or suggest a different one? If so, why and what changes would you make?
\end{blockquote}

I think the provided translation is quite good, but I might suggest a slightly different wording to better convey the meaning of the original phrase. Here's my suggestion:

Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning with the intensity of life on this planet.

Here are the reasons why I would make these changes:

1. ""Mozek"" in Czech can be translated as ""brain"", but it also has a connotation of mental fire or heat, which is not fully captured by the word ""fire"". By using ""burning"", I aim to convey this sense of intense mental activity more accurately.
2. The phrase ""ze života"" in Czech can be translated as ""from life"", but it also implies a sense of overwhelming or all-consuming nature of life experiences. To capture this nuance, I used the word ""intensity"" to convey the idea that life on",0.7781725997,"
   Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning from life on this planet.

The correct translation of the phrase would be something like ""Sometimes it feels to me as if my mind/brain is overheating due to life on this planet."" or ""At times, it's as though my mind/brain were on fire because of life on this planet.""  The word 'mozek' in Czech is an old-fashioned term for brain that sounds a bit like the English word 'mind', but is not commonly used in modern Czech. So, while the translator's phrase might be grammatically correct, it doesn't convey the same meaning as the original Czech sentence.",0.7689195232,Sometimes I feel like my brain is on fire from all the information overload on this planet.,0.86291246

   In 2012, Vit Barta found himself in court with his former co-party member from the VV movement, Jaroslav Skarka.

 Czech: Vít Bárta se stal terčem kritiky ze strany kolegů z VV, kteří ho obvinili z manipulace a neetického chování..
  ",0.8537232912,"
   Vit Barta found himself in court in 2012 with his former fellow party member from VV (Civic Forum) Jaroslav Skarbek.

The translator's work is perfect, but you may be wondering why this particular Czech phrase was chosen for translation. The answer lies in the fact that Vit Barta and Jaroslav Skarbek were both prominent figures in the Civic Forum political party of post-Velvet Revolution Czechoslovakia during the 1990s.

Civic Forum (Občanské forum) was a key player in the peaceful revolution that led to the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989, and it continued as an important political force throughout the following decade. The party's leaders, including Václav Havel and Alexandr Dubček, were highly respected both domestically and internationally for their commitment to democracy and human rights.

Vit Barta was a prominent member of Civic Forum during its heyday in the early 1990s. He served as the party's spokesperson and was known for his charismatic person",0.6022685704,"
  
  Vit Barta found himself in court in 2012 with his former fellow party member from VV Jaroslav Skarka.
  
  Here's a breakdown of how the translation works:
  
  * ""se ocitl"" is translated as ""found himself"", which is an idiomatic expression that captures the idea of someone ending up in a particular situation without intentionally seeking it out.
  * ""u soudu"" is translated as ""in court"", which is a literal translation of the phrase.
  * ""v roce 2012"" is translated as ""in 2012"", which is also a literal translation.
  * ""se svým bývalým spolustraníkem z VV Jaroslavem Škárkou"" is translated as ""with his former fellow party member from VV Jaroslav Skarka"". This phrase is broken down into its individual components and then translated:
	+ ""svým"" is translated as ""his"", which is a possessive pronoun.
	+ ""bývalým spolustraníkem"" is translated as ""former fellow party member"", which captures the idea of someone",0.8229945069,"
   ""Vít Bárta found himself at court with his former comrade from VV Jaroslav Škárka""
  Instead, a more natural translation of this phrase would be:
   ""Vít Bárta was taken to court by his former colleague from VV Jaroslav Škárka in the year 2012"".

Can you explain why the original translator's version is not idiomatic and how your suggested version is more natural?

  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The original translator's version of the phrase ""Vít Bárta se ocitl u soudu v roce 2012 se svým bývalým spolustraníkem z VV Jaroslavem Škárkou"" is not idiomatic for several reasons:

1. The word order is not natural in English. In English, we would typically say ""Vít Bárta was taken to court by his former colleague Jaroslav Škárka in 2012"", rather than ""found himself at court with"".
2. The phrase ""se ocitl u soudu"" is a",0.7626624654,"In 2012, Vit Barta found himself in court with his former fellow party member from the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Jaroslav Skarka.",0.9597897018

The insightful observation is that books can be seen as lives or worlds. This is a beautiful and poetic way to think about literature.

The phrase also emphasizes the idea that each book has its own unique ""life"" or identity, with its own set of characters, plot, and themes.

This is a good example of how a skilled translator can capture the nuances of language and culture to produce an accurate and natural-sounding translation. The Czech phrase ""Knihy jsou ve skutečnosti 'životy' nebo lépe řečeno 'světy'"" conveys the idea that books are not just collections of words, but rather a way to experience different lives or worlds.

The English translation ""Books are actually 'lives' or more precisely 'worlds'"" captures this idea perfectly, using the word ""lives"" to convey the sense of experience and ""worlds"" to emphasize the immersive nature of books. The use of the phrase ""more precisely"" also acknowledges that there may be a loss of nuance in translation, but assures us that the translator has done their best to capture the essence of the original sentence.

""The leftover pieces of audio-visual technology and computers were explained by Dušek.""
  
Can you spot what's wrong with this translation? (Hint: There are several issues.)",0.7765732449,"
  
  Here's the translation of the given sentence ""Zbytek spolkla audiovizuální technika a počítače"" from Czech to English, along with an explanation of each word and its part of speech:
  
  Zbytek (noun) - leftover, remainder
  Spolkla (verb) - broke down, collapsed
  Audiovizuální (adjective) - audio-visual
  Technika (noun) - technology
  Počítače (noun) - computers
  
  So the translation of the original sentence ""Zbytek spolkla audiovizuální technika a počítače"" from Czech to English is:

""The leftover pieces of audio-visual technology and computers were explained by Dušek.""
  
What is wrong with this translation?

HINT: Think about word order, verb tenses, and agreement between words.

ANSWER: The main problem with the translation is that it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase. Here's a corrected version:

""Dušek explained the remaining pieces of audio-visual technology and computers.""

In this version, we have kept the word order of the original sentence, but changed the verb tense to match the present perfect (remaining) instead of the past simple (were). Additionally, we have made sure that the subject (Dušek) agrees with the verb in number (Dušek explained, not were explained).",0.6114240596,"""Most of the modern audio-visual technology and computers have been reduced to scrap metal, explained Dušek.""",0.6969249018

This is a perfect translation, but it doesn't capture the nuance of the original Czech phrase.

2902,Jak hmyzáci z Thajska zvedli tržby pařížského baru,How creepy-crawlies from Thailand have increased revenue at a Paris bar,"
   How the cockroaches from Thailand raised the prices of a Parisian bar.

The story is about how some cockroaches from Thailand were brought to France and ended up in a bar in Paris, where they started selling their own brand of cockroach-based products, such as cockroach milk and cockroach-infused alcohol. The prices for these products were so high that the regular customers of the bar could no longer afford to drink there, leading to a significant increase in the prices of all drinks on the menu.

In this story, ""hmyzáci"" is used as an adjective to describe the cockroaches from Thailand, and ""zvedli"" means ""raised"" or ""increased"".

   How the cockroaches from Thailand raised the prices of the Parisian bar.

The joke relies on a clever play with words in both languages, using

The phrase is saying that the cockroaches from Thailand raised the prices of the Parisian bar, which is absurd and humorous.
  ",0.8079576783,"
   How the cockroaches from Thailand raised the prices of the Parisian bar.

This is a humorous example, but it illustrates how idiomatic expressions and cultural references can be lost in translation. In this case, the Czech phrase relies on a play on words with ""hmyzáci"" (cockroaches) and ""tržby"" (prices), which might not have an exact equivalent in English.

In general, when translating idiomatic expressions or cultural references, it's important to consider the context and intent of the original phrase, as well as any specific cultural references that may be lost in translation. The goal is to convey the same meaning and tone as the original phrase, while also taking into account the nuances of the target language and culture.

Here are some strategies for translating idiomatic expressions and cultural references:

1. Understand the context and intent: Before attempting to translate an idiomatic expression or cultural reference, it's important to understand the context in which it is being used. This can help you determine the best way to convey the same meaning and tone in the target language.
2. Research equivalent expressions: Look for equivalent expressions in the",0.7154295753,"

   ""Vodafone can therefore share its network with Sazka.""

The given sentence is not a correct translation of the original Czech phrase. Here's why:

1. ""se totiž"" - this phrase is often used to indicate irony, sarcasm or even humor. It cannot be translated as straightforwardly as ""can therefore"".
2. ""podělit"" - the word ""podělit"" means ""to share"" in a sense of dividing something between two or more parties. However, in this context, it would not make much sense to translate it as ""share its network"".
3. The sentence structure is also different from the original Czech phrase. In Czech, the verb ""může"" (can) is placed at the end of the sentence, while in English, it would be more common to place it earlier in the sentence.

How would you translate this sentence? What does it mean and why did the incompetent masterful Czech translator mistranslate it?
\end{blockquote}

The correct translation of the given Czech phrase ""Vodafone tak potřebuje partnera"" into English is:

""Vodafone therefore needs a partner.""

However, this sentence in the original Czech text is not a standalone sentence but rather a fragment of a larger context. The word ""tak"" in Czech can have several meanings depending on the context, including ""therefore,"" ""so,"" or ""thus."" In this case, based on the given phrase, it's more likely that the correct translation would be:

""Vodafone needs a partner so/therefore.""

The incompetent masterful Czech translator mistranslated the sentence because they failed to consider the context and the nuances of the original text. They simply translated each word individually without considering how those words fit together or what they convey as a whole. As a result, their translation does not accurately reflect the meaning of the original Czech phrase.",0.4632788883,"""Vodafone needs a partner.""",0.960129412

   His last place of work was the Suzuki Motor Czech company, where he spent over five years in the position of manager of the automotive division.

The translation is correct and natural-sounding, but it does not capture some essential nuances of the original Czech phrase that a native English speaker might notice:
  1. The word ""posledním"" can be translated as either ""last"" or ""final"", but in this context, it carries more connotations of finality and definitiveness than just plain ""last"". 
 2. The word ""působištěm"" is a bit harder to translate; it refers to the place where someone works or resides, but also has some connotations of permanence and stability. In this context, it suggests that the speaker's work at Suzuki Motor Czech was not just a temporary gig, but rather a long-term position.
 3. The phrase ""v níž"" is a bit awkward to translate; it can be translated as ""in which"", but it also carries some connotations of the speaker's expertise or specialization in that particular field. In this context, it suggests that the speaker had",0.6553873355,"
   His last workplace was the Suzuki Motor Czech company, where he spent over five years in the position of manager of the automotive division.

The correct answer is indeed ""His last workplace was..."" and not ""Jeho posledním působištěm byla..."", which would be a grammatical error as ""působiště"" is an uncountable noun, whereas ""workplace"" is a countable one.

  Here's a breakdown of what was lost in translation and why it matters:

1. Word order: The original Czech phrase has the word ""odvolací"" (appeal) before ""federální soud"" (federal court), indicating that the appeal is being made to the federal court. In the English version, this relationship is lost, as ""appeals"" comes after ""court"".
2. Prepositions: The Czech phrase uses the preposition ""do"" (to) to indicate the direction of the postponement (i.e., the decision will be postponed until the appeal is decided). In the English version, the preposition ""until"" is used instead, which changes the meaning slightly and loses some precision.
3. Legal terminology: The original Czech phrase uses the term ""soudkyně"" (judge) to refer to the judge who made the decision. This legal terminology is lost in the English version, where ""Judge Shira Scheindlin""",0.7069586074,"The second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the decision by Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed until a final ruling on the city's appeal is made.

In this sentence, the word ""uncertain"" is an adjective used to describe the choices available to parents in the context of the German law. The word ""neurčité"" in Czech has a similar meaning, but it can also be interpreted as ""undecided"" or ""unspecified"".

So, the correct translation of ""neurčité"" in this sentence would be ""uncertain"", but not necessarily ""undecided"" or ""unspecified"".",0.8884230349,"

The translator's use of the phrase ""hasty decisions"" is also significant, as it suggests that parents may be inclined to make rash choices without fully considering the consequences.

What does this suggest about the layout of the flat?

Answer: Based on the translation, we can infer that the flat has limited storage space and is optimized for functionality. The fact that books are being stored in multiple locations, including under the windowsill, suggests that every available space is being used to its fullest potential.

* The word ""coincidence"" may not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase.

In this context, ""random event"" or ""unrelated occurrence"" might be more appropriate.
* The word ""indicate"" may not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase either.

   I did it for the first time in my life and it went downhill from there.

The phrase ""Dělala jsem to poprvé v životě"" is a grammatically correct sentence, but it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the original English phrase. The word order is different, and the verb tense is not the same. In Czech, the verb ""dělat"" (to do) is in the past tense, while in English, the verb ""do"" is in the present participle. Additionally, the word ""poprvé"" (for the first time) is not necessary in English, and the phrase ""it went downhill from there"" is a more idiomatic way to express the idea of something going wrong after a successful start.

The masterful Czech translator has taken these differences into account and provided a translation that captures the essence of the original phrase while still being grammatically correct in Czech. The use of ""I did it for the first time"" instead of ""I did it poprvé v životě"" is a more natural way to express the idea, and the phrase ""it went downhill from there"" is a more common idiom in",0.4828142361,"

Explanation:

The original Czech sentence contains several idiomatic expressions and wordplay that make it challenging to translate directly into English. Here's a breakdown of each part of the sentence and how I translated it:

1. Někteří návštěvníci - Some visitors (literally ""certain guests""). The phrase is used to emphasize that not all visitors may be planning to support Russian gay pride.

3. ruské gaye - Russian gay pride (literally ""Russian gay""). The word ""gay"" is used to refer to the LGBTQ+ community in English, but it's important to note that this term may not be universally accepted or understood in all cultures and languages.

The correct answer is:

Some visitors plan to show their support for Russian LGBTQ+ rights during the Olympics.

Explanation:

In this sentence, ""ruské gaye"" refers to Russian LGBTQ+ individuals and the phrase ""na olympiádě podpořit"" means ""to support at the Olympics"". The word ""gay"" is not used in its original meaning of referring to sexual orientation, but rather as a shorthand for ""LGBTQ+"" or ""rainbow"" community. Therefore, the correct translation should be more specific and accurate when conveying the intended message.",0.8491765146,"
   Some visitors are planning to support Russian gay at the Olympics.

The correct translation is:
  Some visitors are planning to support the Russian team at the Olympics.

What's wrong with the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version?

There are several issues with the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version:

1. The phrase ""ruské gaye"" is not a correct translation of ""Russian team."" ""Gay"" means homosexual, and using it to refer to a sports team is not appropriate.

In the Czech phrase, the words ""se tedy"" come before ""stává"", whereas in the English translation they come after ""stává"". This slight difference in word order does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it could potentially make a difference in certain contexts or when comparing the two phrases side by side.
    - The phrase ""nejvýznamnějším"" is translated as ""most important"", which is an accurate translation, but it might be worth considering alternative translations such as ""the most popular"" or ""the most widely used"". This could potentially provide more context and nuance to the sentence, depending on the situation.

   ""The internet, therefore, becomes the most significant medium for publishing job offers.""

Is this a good translation? Why or why not? What would be a better way to translate this sentence?
\end{code}

No, this is not a good translation. Here's why:

* ""stává"" should be translated as ""is becoming"", not ""becomes"". The verb tense in the original Czech phrase is present continuous, indicating an ongoing process.
* ""nejvýznamnějším"" should be translated as ""most significant"", not ""the most significant"". The word order in the original Czech phrase is different from the English translation, which can affect the meaning of the sentence.
* ""zveřejňování"" should be translated as ""publishing"", not ""offering"". The verb ""zveřejnit"" means to publish or make publicly available, so the correct word choice in this context is ""publishing"".

Here's a better way to translate the sentence:

""The internet is becoming the most significant medium for publishing job offers.""

   Instead of reporting the problem, they were deterred by their friendship with Lord and therefore did not report it.

The following are possible errors in the original Czech sentence that could result in an incorrect translation:
  1. Word order: The word order in the original sentence may be different from the word order in English, which can affect the meaning of the sentence. For example, if the phrase ""se svým přátelstvím s Lordem"" (with their friendship with Lord) is placed at the end of the sentence, it could change the emphasis and potentially alter the translation.
  2. Idiomatic expressions: Czech and English have different idiomatic expressions, which can be difficult to translate accurately. For example, the phrase ""jemnilo jejich úsudek"" (tempered their judgment) may not have an exact equivalent in English, and a more appropriate expression might need to be used.
  3. False friends: Czech and English have many false friends, which are words that appear similar but have different meanings. For example, the word ""řekl"" (he said) is a common verb in Czech, but it does not have an exact equivalent in English. A more appropriate",0.7643957221,"

However, upon closer inspection of the original phrase and its translation, it becomes apparent that there are some significant differences in meaning between the two versions. Specifically:

1. The word ""nový"" (new) in the Czech phrase is not present in the English translation. This omission changes the connotation of the sentence slightly, as the emphasis shifts from Pamela Anderson having a brand new haircut to simply her having a different one.
2. The word order of the two phrases differs. In Czech, the phrase begins with ""Pamela Anderson,"" while in English, it starts with ""the latest celebrity."" This alteration affects the emphasis and flow of the sentence.
3. The term ""celebrity"" is used in the English translation instead of ""fanoušky"" (fans) as seen in the original Czech phrase. While both words convey a sense of fame, they have slightly different connotations.

However, I think that ""varlata"" should be translated as ""testes"", not ""organs"". In addition, the phrase ""vnější orgány"" is redundant, since ""varlata"" already implies that only internal organs are being referred to. Therefore, the correct translation would be:

Furthermore, the use of ""raised him as a girl"" is also inaccurate and offensive, as it implies that being transgender is somehow lesser or wrong.

4. krizi - This is a feminine gender noun that refers to a crisis or difficulty. It is often used in formal language and has a strong connotation of urgency and importance. In this context, it indicates the potential consequences of not having enough capacity in our railway network.

   In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years in 1970.

Here's a breakdown of the translation process:

1. Ve (pronounced ""vay"") - means ""in"" or ""at"" in Czech.
2. Spojených státech (pronounced ""spozh-yayn-stah-teh-ch"") - is the name for the United States in Czech, literally meaning ""united states.""
3. je nyní (pronounced ""yeh nee"") - means ""is now"" or ""currently"" in Czech.
4. průměrným věkem (pronounced ""roo-murm-yern-vayg-eh-m"") - means ""average age"" in Czech, with ""průměr"" meaning ""average"" and ""věk"" meaning ""age.""
5. 12,5 let (pronounced ""twelve point five letters"") - is the translation of the number 12.5 into Czech. The word order for numbers in Czech is different",0.7348485566,"
   ""In the United States, there is now an average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.""

The correct translation would be:
""In the United States, the average age is currently 12.5 years, compared to 12.75 years in 1970.""

   Because I didn't want to drive on another branch, my registration failed, so I moved and as a result, my address and citizen ID number changed.

Here is an explanation of how this translation was done:

1. A protože - This preposition can be translated as ""because"" or ""since."" In this case, it introduces the reason for the speaker's actions.
2. se mi nechtělo jezdit na jinou pobočku - This phrase means ""I didn't want to drive on another branch,"" using the metaphor of a car journey to describe the process of registering something (e.g., a change of address). The word ""pobočku"" can be translated as ""branch"" or ""division.""
3. registrace propadla - This phrase means ""registration failed,"" using the verb ""propadnout"" to indicate that the registration was unsuccessful.
4. pak jsem se přestěhoval - This sentence means ""so I moved,"" using the word ""přestěhovat"" to describe the act of relocating one's residence or business.
5. dí",0.8569853778,"
   Because I didn't want to drive on another branch, my registration failed, so I moved and as a result, my address and ID number changed.

The masterful translator has captured the essential meaning of the original sentence in an accurate and idiomatic way. However, there are some minor issues with the translation:
  1. ""A protože"" is not strictly necessary in this context; it can be safely omitted. 
    The phrase could begin directly with ""Se mi nechtělo jezdit na jinou pobočku.""
  2. ""registrace propadla"" should perhaps be translated as ""my registration failed"" or ""I didn't pass the registration test,"" rather than simply ""propadla."" 
    The word ""propadla"" is a bit formal, and it may not convey the same connotation of disappointment or frustration that the original phrase does.  
  3. ""pak jsem se přestěhoval"" could be translated as either ""so I moved"" or ""then I relocated."" 
    The word ""přestěhoval"" is a bit more formal than ""moved,"" but it's",0.7664708876,"
   Because I didn't want to drive on another branch, my registration failed, so I moved and because of that my address and citizen card number changed.

What is wrong with this translation? Can you suggest a better one?

Hint: The original Czech sentence has some idiomatic expressions and word order that are not easily translatable into English. Also, the phrase ""se mi nechtělo"" can be translated as ""I didn't feel like it"", but in this context it means something more like ""it was not possible for me"".

   It was artificially staged to label me as a person who gives money where it does not belong.

The sentence is quite long and complex, but the translation captures all its nuances in an excellent way. The use of ""artificially staged"" accurately conveys the idea that something was deliberately set up or fabricated to achieve a certain goal, while ""label me as"" perfectly renders the sense of being categorized or identified as someone who engages in a particular behavior. Additionally, ""where it does not belong"" is a great choice for capturing the meaning of the original phrase's ""kam nepatří"", which implies that money is being given to something that is not its rightful recipient. Overall, this translation is top-notch and effectively communicates the intended message.",0.7950677279,"
   It was artificially staged to label me as a person who gives money where it does not belong.

The word 'zinscenováno' is derived from the words 'scéna', meaning stage or scene, and 'zeníť', which means to direct or manage.  In this context, the phrase suggests that someone has deliberately created a situation in order to make someone else appear in a certain light or to fulfill a particular purpose.

\end{blockquote}

No, the given English translation is not entirely accurate. Here's a more faithful rendering of the original Czech phrase:

Bylo to uměle zinscenováno, aby mě mohli označit za člověka, quien da dinero en el lugar equivocado (lit. ""It was artificially staged to label me as a person who gives money in the wrong place"").

The Czech phrase is using a play on words, where ""zinscenováno"" (artificially staged) and ""nepatří"" (does not belong) are used together to create a humorous effect. The phrase suggests that someone is trying to portray the speaker as a foolish person who gives money away unnecessarily or in the wrong place.

   After that we would rewind those cassette tapes and play them again until we got drunk.

In this example, the original phrase is a nostalgic memory of listening to music on cassette tapes, specifically rewinding them and playing them repeatedly while drinking alcohol. The translation captures the essence of the original phrase in English, using words such as ""rewind"" and ""play again"" to convey the action of listening to music multiple times, and ""drunk"" to indicate the consumption of alcohol.

Overall, this example illustrates how a skilled translator can take a sentence or phrase from one language and express it in another language while still conveying its original meaning and context.",0.6607737629,"
   After that we would always turn on those cassettes and play them all day long one by one, our favorite song, and we would drink it with a straw.

What is wrong with this translation?

HINT: The word ""si"" in Czech is often used to indicate reciprocity or reflexive action, but it does not have an exact equivalent in English.

ANSWER: In the original phrase, ""si na tužce ty kazety přetáčely"" means that the speaker and someone else (perhaps a group of people) are turning on the cassettes together, repeatedly playing one song each time. The word ""si"" indicates reciprocity or reflexive action - they are both actively participating in the activity.

In the translation, however, this nuance is lost and it sounds like only one person is drinking with a straw (singular ""a straw"") rather than multiple people acting together. Additionally, the word ""pouštěly"" means ""played"" or ""put on,"" not ""drank."" So the translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original phrase.",0.7104564308,"""Then we would rewind the tape and play the same song over and over again, our favorite one, while drinking from a siphon.""

  Here's how the translation was done, step by step:
   1. Nyní - Now (literal)
   2. ale - however (indicates a contrast or contradiction)
   3. vědci - scientists (singular form of ""scienti"" in Czech)
   4. říkají - say (verb conjugated for the third person singular present tense)
   5. že - that (subordinating conjunction introducing a subordinate clause)
   6. ostatní psi - other dogs (plural form of ""pes"" in Czech, where ""pes"" is also used as an ordinary noun meaning ""dog"")
   7. dokáží - can (verb conjugated for the third person plural present tense)
   8. tyto jemné rozdíly v pohybu ocasu - these subtle differences in tail movement ( literal translation of the phrase as it is written, using the word order and grammar of Czech)
   9. zaznamenat a reagovat",0.7482972715,"
   However, scientists now say that other dogs can detect these subtle differences in tail movement and respond to them.

This translation preserves the meaning of the original sentence while also making it more concise and natural-sounding in English. The word "" však"" is translated as ""however,"" which accurately conveys the contrast between the previous statement and the new information provided. Additionally, the phrase ""other dogs can detect these subtle differences in tail movement and respond to them"" is a more natural way of expressing the idea that other dogs are able to recognize and react to the slight variations in the dog's tail movements, as compared to the original sentence which uses the phrase ""reagovat na ně.""",0.7830597092,"

   For the CSSD, Sobotka is negotiating...

This sentence uses the abbreviation ""CSSD"" to refer to the Czech Social Democratic Party (Česká strana sociálně demokratická). The word ""vyjednávat"" has several meanings, including ""to negotiate"", so it's not entirely clear what kind of negotiation is being referred to. However, based on the context and the fact that the sentence mentions Sobotka (the leader of the CSSD), it seems likely that the negotiation in question is political in nature, perhaps related to forming a government or passing legislation.",0.5807873646,"
   For the CSSD, Sobotka negotiates...

  However, a small error creeps in. What is it?

  Hint: Look carefully at the word order and punctuation.",0.6311236009,"
   ""For CSSD, Sobotka negotiates.""

  However, a more casual or idiomatic translation might be:
   ""Sobotka is negotiating for CSSD.""

  Which of these two options better captures the meaning and conveys the intended message? Why?
\end{blockquote}

Both translations are grammatically correct, but they convey different nuances.

The first translation, ""For CSSD, Sobotka negotiates,"" is more formal and emphasizes that Sobotka is acting as a representative of CSSD in the negotiation process. It suggests that CSSD has delegated the task of negotiation to Sobotka, and she is carrying out this responsibility on their behalf.

The second translation, ""Sobotka is negotiating for CSSD,"" is more casual and emphasizes that Sobotka is directly involved in the negotiation process as an advocate for CSSD's interests. It suggests a more personal involvement and agency on Sobotka's part, rather than simply being a representative of CSSD.

In terms of conveying the intended message, the second translation might be",0.61308393,"
   For CSSD, negotiates Sobotka.

What's wrong with this translation? What should be the correct translation of the given Czech phrase?

Hint: The name ""Sobotka"" is a proper noun and refers to a specific person.

Answer:

The problem with the incompetent masterful Czech translator's translation is that they have not properly capitalized the name ""Sobotka"", which should be capitalized because it is a proper noun referring to a specific person, specifically the former Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Sobotka.

The correct translation of the given Czech phrase would be:

3. Combine the equivalents into a cohesive translation of the original sentence:

The company claims that these companies have been using their technologies without permission or compensation.

  2. Accused (as in, charged with a crime or wrongdoing)
  3. Complained about (as in, filed a complaint or grievance)

In the context of your sentence, ""žalovány"" is most likely being used to mean ""sued,"" as it makes sense that companies like Google, Samsung, and Huawei would be taking legal action against Nortel over patents.

This translation captures the essence of the original Czech phrase perfectly, while also conveying the nuances of the language and cultural context.

Is this a good translation? If not, what would be a better one? 
Here's why I think the current translation is lacking:

1. The word ""vyjádřili"" in Czech is often translated as ""expressed concerns"", but it can also mean ""indicated"" or ""pointed out"". So the first part of the sentence could be more accurately translated as ""Politicians indicated/pointed out that the EU lacks certain skills..."".
2. The phrase ""a uvedli"" is a bit awkward in English, and it's not entirely clear what it's trying to convey. A better translation might be ""and emphasized"" or ""and highlighted"".
3. The word ""svou"" in Czech is a possessive pronoun meaning ""its"", but in this context, it seems more appropriate to use the phrase ""the EU's dependence on the US"".
4. Finally, the sentence structure is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity",0.8543401004,"""Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain digital and internet skills, and said it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.""",0.9649171825

   I am looking forward to reviewing the report on this study together with British ministers during the next year and making joint decisions about further steps.

Here are some key differences between the original Czech phrase and its translation:

1. Word order: The word order in the two phrases is different. In the Czech phrase, ""Těším se na přezkoumání zprávy"" (I am looking forward to reviewing), the verb ""těžit"" (to look) comes before the object ""přezkoumání zprávy"" (the report). In the English translation, the word order is reversed: ""I am looking forward to reviewing the report"".
2. Prepositions: The Czech phrase uses the preposition ""na"" (on), which is translated as ""during"" in the English version.
3. Verb tense: The verb tense in the two phrases differs. The Czech phrase uses the present tense (""těším se""), while the English translation uses the future tense (""I am looking forward to"").
4. Word choice: Some words have been translated differently between the two languages. For example, ""spolu"" (t",0.7307680144,"
   ""I am looking forward to reviewing the report on this study together with British ministers during the next year and reaching joint decisions on further steps.""

The translation is accurate, but it doesn't capture the nuance of the original Czech phrase. Here are some key differences between the two languages that affect the meaning:

1. Word order: The word order in Czech is different from English. In Czech, the verb ""těším se"" (I am looking forward to) comes before the object of the sentence, whereas in English it typically comes after the subject. This changes the emphasis of the phrase slightly.
2. Prepositions: Czech uses prepositions differently than English. The phrase ""spolu s britskými ministry"" can be translated as ""together with British ministers,"" but the word ""spolu"" is more literally translated as ""jointly."" This changes the connotation of the phrase slightly, making it sound more collaborative.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The Czech phrase contains an idiomatic expression ""přezkoumání zprávy,"" which can be translated as ""reviewing the report,"" but it doesn't capture the same level of detail or specific",0.6324544558,"

678,Já jen mohu zavřít oči a zase je pomalu otevřít...,I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...,"
   I can only close my eyes and then slowly open them again.

This is a famous quote from the book ""The Good Soldier Svejk"" by Jaroslav Hašek, where the protagonist Svejk describes his method of dealing with difficult situations. The phrase has become a popular idiom in Czech language, used to describe a situation when someone is unable to do anything about something but can only observe it passively.

In English, the quote is often translated as ""I can only close my eyes and then slowly open them again"" which loses some of the nuance of the original Czech phrase. A more literal translation would be ""I can only shut my eyes and then slowly reopen them"".",0.4170743198,"

Can you come up with a humorous or ironic explanation for why the incompetent masterful Czech translator translated the phrase as they did?

Here are some possible explanations that might be considered humorous or ironic:

1. The translator was so focused on ""mohu"" (meaning ""I can"") that they forgot about the rest of the sentence entirely! 😳
2. They thought ""zavřít oči"" meant something like ""to close a deal,"" and ""otevřít"" meant ""to open up new opportunities."" 💼
3. The translator was trying to be overly literal with their translation, so they interpreted ""mohu zavřít oči"" as ""I can physically close my eyes"" and ""zase je pomalu otevřít"" as ""and then slowly open them again."" 🙄

   How did you perceive it when the Ostrava leadership of the CSSD rejected your candidacy?

Note that in this example, the word ""vnímat"" is used to ask about the person's subjective experience or perception of a situation. The word ""schválit"" means ""to approve"" or ""to accept"", and in this context, it refers to the Ostrava leadership of the CSSD not approving the person's candidacy for some position.",0.8974090488,"
   How did you perceive that, they didn't approve your candidacy by the Ostrava leadership of CSSD?

The word ""vnímat"" is a very interesting word in Czech. It has several meanings and connotations, but one of its primary definitions is to perceive or experience something. In this context, it implies that someone (the speaker) wants to know how the listener experienced or interpreted some event or information.
  The phrase ""jak jste vnímal"" can be translated as ""how did you feel about it?"" or ""what was your take on that?"". It is a very polite and neutral way of asking for someone's perspective on something, which makes the conversation more open-ended and less confrontational.
  This word also has some nuances in its usage that are worth noting:
  1. The word ""vnímat"" is often used when discussing emotions or sensory experiences, such as ""How did you feel about the movie?"" or ""What did you think of the food?"". It implies a more subjective experience rather than objective factual information.
  2. In some cases, the phrase ""jak jste vnímal"" can",0.5943926089,"
   ""How did you perceive that the Ostrava leadership of the CSSD did not approve your candidacy?""

The issue is that the word order in the original sentence does not accurately convey the meaning of the phrase. The Czech sentence places a greater emphasis on the fact that it was the Ostrava leadership and their decision, rather than the candidate's perception of whether they were approved or not.  In English, we would typically place more emphasis on the candidate's perspective by using phrases such as ""How did you feel about..."", ""What was your reaction to..."" etc.

The correct translation should take into account this difference in word order and focus:

""How did you react when the Ostrava leadership of the CSSD rejected your candidacy?""
This wording better conveys the idea that the decision was made by the leadership, rather than simply stating the candidate's perception of their approval.",0.7566884955,"

   And I'm wondering why the doctor was sent to space to fix technology.

In this example, the word ""diví"" is used to express the speaker's confusion or puzzlement about why the doctor was sent to space to fix technology. The word can be translated as ""wondering"" or ""puzzled"".",0.9094405802,"
   ""Plus, they were amazed why Doctor was sent to space to repair technology.""

But here's where things get interesting. If we take a closer look at the original
  Czech phrase, we can see that it contains a subtle nuance that is lost in the
  translation. Specifically, the word ""diví"" has a connotation of irony or
  incredulity. In other words, the speaker is not just amazed by the fact that
  Doctor was sent to space, but they are also expressing disbelief or
  skepticism at the absurdity of the situation.

So, how can we capture this nuance in our translation? One way to do so
  would be to use the word ""disbelieve"" instead of ""amazed"". This would
  better convey the speaker's incredulous tone and their inability to
  comprehend why Doctor was sent to space. Here's how the translated
  sentence might look:

""Plus, they disbelieved why Doctor was sent to space to repair
  technology.""

By using ""disbelieve"", we can more accurately convey the speaker's

However, there is a slight difference in word order between the two languages. In Czech, the verb ""se diví"" (to be surprised) comes before the subject of the sentence, whereas in English, it comes after the subject.

- The word ""vyprostit"" is not commonly used in everyday language, but it's more common in formal or official contexts.

1. The phrase ""federální pomocný balíček"" might be better translated as ""federal aid package"" or simply ""aid package,"" rather than ""federal help."" This is because the original Czech sentence uses the word ""pomocný,"" which specifically means ""helpful"" or ""assisting,"" whereas ""federální"" just means ""federal.""
2. The phrase ""vyprostit státní veřejné zdravotnictví"" might be better translated as ""extricate state public healthcare from its critical situation,"" rather than simply ""get it out of.""

Hint: pay attention to word order and verb tenses!

Answer: There are several issues with the translation:

1. Word order: The original Czech phrase has the subject ""Lékaři"" (doctors) before the object ""v Praze"" (in Prague), while in English, we would expect the reverse word order: ""Doctors in Prague"".
2. Verb tense: The original Czech phrase uses the present perfect ""evidovali"" (they have diagnosed), which is not correctly translated into English using a simple past tense like ""diagnosed"". Instead, we should use the present perfect ""have diagnosed"" to maintain the same verb tense in both languages.
3. Prepositions: The original Czech phrase uses the preposition ""v"" (in) to indicate location, while in English, we would use the preposition ""in"" instead.

The word ""ledabyle"" in the original Czech phrase is particularly interesting because it can be translated to English as either ""casually"" or ""carelessly,"" but its connotation is more nuanced than these simple translations suggest. In this context, ""ledabyle"" implies a lack of seriousness or importance attached to the subject matter being discussed - Wayne Shorter's supposed daydreaming about extraterrestrial life on Earth is portrayed as a frivolous and non-essential activity, rather than a weighty and important one.

The translator's use of ""casually"" in the English translation captures this nuance effectively, while also conveying the idea that Shorter would not seriously entertain such fantastical ideas. The phrase ""a little bit of daydreaming"" is also a nice touch, as it suggests that Shorter might occasionally indulge in flights of fancy without taking them too seriously.",0.8991967056,"

This text is discussing the challenge of translating words from one language to another, specifically focusing on the Czech word ""chlastat"" and its English equivalent. The author argues that while a direct translation of ""I am after death and in my current new life, I cannot indulge"" is accurate, it does not fully capture the nuance of the original phrase because ""chlastat"" carries connotations of self-indulgence or overindulgence.

   From the state of graves we will also learn how the survivors cherish their dead.

The phrase is a clever play on words, using the word ""hruby"" (graves) to create a pun with the word ""dbají"" (cherish). The translator has successfully captured this nuance and conveyed it in English. Great job!",0.6665724148,"

Thank you!  This task is designed to help me practice my Czech language skills, so please provide detailed explanations for each error or issue found in the provided translation.  I am eager to learn from my mistakes and improve my understanding of this beautiful language!

Additionally, if there are any cultural nuances that need to be considered when translating this phrase into English, please include those as well.   Culturally-sensitive translations can help ensure that the intended message is conveyed accurately and with appropriate respect for Czech customs and traditions.",0.6721654994,"And even from the state of graves, it is clear that the dead are cared for by their loved ones.",0.6856119655
2237,"Barvy jsem nechala na architektech, přála jsem si, aby to bylo radostné.","I left the colourdesign to the architects, I wanted it to be cheerful.","
   I left the colors up to the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.",0.9301637797,"
  
""I left the colors with the architects; I wanted it to be joyful.""

The translation is perfect. However, there are a few small issues that require attention:

1. ""Barvy"" should be translated as ""colors"" or ""hues,"" not ""colours."" The word ""barva"" in Czech is feminine and takes the article ""je"" instead of ""se"" when referring to multiple colors.
2. ""Nechala"" should be translated as ""left with,"" not just ""left."" This phrase implies that the speaker entrusted the architects with the task of selecting the colors.
3. The word order in the original Czech sentence is slightly different from the English translation. In Czech, the verb ""přála jsem si"" comes before the subject ""Barvy,"" which emphasizes the speaker's desire for joyful colors. To maintain this nuance, the English sentence could be rephrased as:
  
""I desired that it be joyful; I left the colors with the architects.""

With these minor adjustments, the translation becomes even more accurate and natural-sounding in both languages.",0.7427531601,"
   I left the colors on architects, I wanted it to be joyful.

Here's a breakdown of how the translation was done:

1. Barvy (colors) is translated as ""colours"" in British English, which is the preferred spelling in this context because it is more common in the UK than ""color"" and sounds more natural when spoken aloud.
2. Nechala (I left) is translated as ""left"" to maintain the same verb tense and keep the sentence structure simple.
3. Na architektech (on architects) is translated as ""on architects"" to maintain the original phrase's meaning and word order.
4. Přála jsem si (I wanted it to be) is translated as ""I wanted it to be"" to maintain the same sentence structure and convey the desired outcome.
5. Radostné (joyful) is translated as ""joyful"" because it is a more natural translation of the word than other possible options like ""happy"" or ""cheerful."" It also maintains the positive connotation of the original phrase.",0.7494274668,"
   ""I have left the colors on architects, I wanted it to be joyful.""

What is wrong with this translation? What would a good translation of the original Czech phrase look like?

Hint: The word order in the two languages differs significantly. In Czech, verbs often come at the end of sentences or clauses, while in English they tend to come earlier. Also, some words may have different connotations in each language.",0.5369359552,"I left the colors up to the architects and engineers, but I wanted it to be joyful...",0.9013200392

  ""The spokesperson for the annual horse show said: 'Fenton has only three horses, but he knows how to handle a mule.'""
  
  Here's why this translation is masterful:
  
  * The Czech phrase uses the word ""poníka,"" which specifically refers to a female donkey or mule. The translator accurately renders this word as ""mule"" in English, rather than using a more general term like ""donkey.""
  * The original Czech phrase is a clever play on words, with ""ovládat poníka"" (to handle a mule) sounding similar to the name ""Fenton."" The translator preserves this wordplay in the English translation.
  * By using the phrase ""how to handle a mule,"" the translator conveys the idea that Fenton has expertise in dealing with difficult or stubborn animals, rather than simply having three horses. This nuance is lost in the original Czech phrase, but it adds depth and humor to the English translation.
  Overall, this translation demonstrates a high level of linguistic skill and cultural sensitivity, as well as an ability to convey",0.7274432219,"

   German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr. Snowden on Thursday in Russia where he was granted asylum and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: There are two major errors in the translation, one related to word order and the other related to vocabulary choice.

Answer:

1. Word order: The phrase ""se setkal s panem Snowdenem"" should be translated as ""met with Mr. Snowden"", not ""setcal with"".
2. Vocabulary choice: The word ""azyl"" is a Czech term for ""asylum"", but it is not commonly used in English. A more appropriate translation would be ""refuge"".

  But the question is: Is this really an accurate translation? Does it truly convey the meaning and intent of the original Czech phrase? Let's take a closer look..
  
  Firstly, the word ""škodlivin"" in Czech specifically refers to harmful substances or pollutants that can cause damage to people, animals, or the environment. In contrast, the English translation uses the more general term ""pollutants,"" which does not convey the same level of specificity and urgency as the original Czech phrase..
  
  Secondly, while the English translation accurately conveys the idea that the amount of pollutants did not exceed certain limits, it does not fully capture the nuance of the original Czech sentence.

   Dead elderly man with a broken head found by relatives who thought he must have fallen and injured himself alone.

The Czech sentence is in the present tense, indicating that the event is happening now or has just happened. The English translation uses the past tense to indicate that the event occurred before the current time.

The translation is perfect, capturing both the meaning of the original Czech phrase and its idiomatic expressions. The use of ""senior"" to refer to an older person is also appropriate, as it is commonly used in English to describe someone who is elderly or aged. Additionally, the word choice for ""rozbitou hlavou"" (broken head) is spot on, as it accurately conveys the idea that the person's head was injured and not just that they fell and hit their head.

   Dead senior with a crushed head found by relatives who thought he must have fallen and injured himself.

The translation is excellent, but it doesn't quite capture the nuance of the original phrase. Here are some possible reasons why:

1. Word order: The word order in Czech is different from English. In Czech, the verb ""našli"" (found) comes before the subject ""příbuzní"" (relatives), whereas in English, we would say ""Relatives found..."". This can affect the emphasis and flow of the sentence.
2. Idiomatic expressions: The phrase ""s rozbitou hlavou"" (with a crushed head) is an idiomatic expression that doesn't have a direct translation in English. It's more common to say ""with a broken neck"" or ""with severe head injuries"", but these phrases don't convey the same level of detail and specificity as the original phrase.

   The old truth that it is better to show than to describe...

This proverb suggests that it is more effective to demonstrate something through action or example rather than simply explaining it in words. It emphasizes the importance of showing, rather than telling, in order to convey a message or make an impact. This can be applied to many areas of life, such as teaching, marketing, and communication.

For example, if you want to teach someone how to play a sport, it is more effective to show them how to do it yourself, rather than just explaining the rules and techniques. Similarly, if you are trying to sell a product or service, it is often more persuasive to demonstrate its benefits through real-life examples, rather than simply listing off its features and advantages.

Overall, this proverb highlights the power of demonstration and example in communication, and encourages us to show, rather than tell, in order to make a lasting impression.",0.359006296,"
   ""It's better to show than to describe.""

The correct answer is (A) It's better to show than to describe.",0.5319730678,"
   It's better to show than to describe.

The phrase ""Stará pravda"" is translated as ""old truth"". This formulation is used when a statement has been considered true for a long time, and it is not necessary to provide evidence or proof of its validity. The word ""pravda"" in Czech means both ""truth"" and ""right"", so the phrase can be interpreted as ""an old right"" or ""a well-established truth"".

The translation of the phrase into English, ""It's better to show than to describe,"" is a literal translation that conveys the meaning of the original Czech phrase. The word ""ukázat"" in Czech means ""to show"", and ""popisovat"" means ""to describe"". By using these two verbs, the Czech phrase emphasizes the importance of demonstrating something rather than simply talking about it.

The given Czech phrase is `Stará pravda o tom, že je lepší ukázat než popisovat..` and its translation into English by an incompetent masterful Czech translator is:

""`Old truth about showing instead of describing...""

There are a few issues with this translation:

1. The phrase `Stará pravda` should be translated as ""old saying"" or ""proverb"", not ""old truth"".
2. The phrase `je lepší ukázat než popisovat` is a literal translation of the idiomatic expression ""show, don't tell"", but it doesn't convey the same meaning in English. A more appropriate translation would be ""it's better to show than to describe"".

808,"Protože její androgenní receptory jsou vadné, vyvinuly se u Katie ženské rysy.","Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.","
   Because her androgen receptors are faulty, she developed female features.

In this example, the word ""protože"" is used to introduce a subordinate clause that explains why something happened. The verb tense in the main clause (vyvinuly) is in the past tense, while the verb tense in the subordinate clause (jsou vadné) is in the present tense. This contrast between the two clauses emphasizes the cause-and-effect relationship between the faulty androgen receptors and Katie's development of female features.

In addition to introducing a subordinate clause, ""protože"" can also be used as an alternative to ""jaký"" or ""když"" to introduce a relative clause that provides additional information about the subject. For example:

The phrase is a paraphrase of a sentence from a scientific article about a person with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). The Czech translator has successfully conveyed the meaning of the original sentence in English while maintaining the nuances of the source language.

Here are some possible ways to improve the translation:

1. Use more precise terminology: Instead of ""androgenic receptors,"" consider using ""androgen receptor"" or ""AR"" to be more specific and technical.
2. Clarify the meaning of ""vadné"": While ""vadné"" can be translated as ""defective,"" it might be more accurate to use a term like ""dysfunctional"" or ""impairment"" to convey that the receptors are not functioning properly.
3. Use gender-neutral language: To avoid assuming Katie's gender, consider using gender-neutral pronouns such as ""they"" instead of ""she.""
4. Simplify the sentence structure: The original sentence is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it down",0.7828834461,"

The phrase is grammatically correct, but it is a bit wordy and lacks the nuance of the original Czech sentence. Here's a more idiomatic English translation:

One of twenty American kids has a food allergy.

In this version, we use the informal ""American kids"" to make the sentence sound more natural in English. We also omit the phrase ""in the United States,"" as it is implied by the context and doesn't add anything essential to the meaning of the sentence. The result is a more concise and idiomatic translation that better conveys the intended message.",0.5232947653,"

Is this a correct translation? Why or why not? What would be a better way to translate this sentence from Czech to English?

No, this is not a correct translation for several reasons:

1. The phrase ""Jedno z 20 dětí"" should be translated as ""One of the twenty children,"" not ""one of the twenty.""
2. The word ""ve Spojených státech"" should be translated as ""in the United States,"" not just ""in the States.""

   I was searching for my book in their eyes and then they showed me a tattered, worn-out copy of my own book.

In this sentence, ""hleděl"" is the first verb in the sentence, and it means ""searched"". The second verb, ""jsem,"" is in the imperfective aspect, which indicates that the action of searching was ongoing or continuous. The third verb, ""do očí"", means ""into their eyes.""

The fourth verb, ""mi byl ukázán,"" is in the passive voice and means ""was shown to me"". The fifth verb, ""rozdrbaný, očtený exemplář mé knihy"", means ""a tattered, worn-out copy of my own book"".

So, the sentence can be translated as ""I was searching for my book in their eyes and then they showed me a tattered, worn-out copy of my own book.""",0.8071195014,"
   I was looking for them in their eyes and then my book was shown to me torn and worn out.

This is a great example of how even seemingly simple phrases can be challenging to translate, especially when it comes to idiomatic expressions that don't have direct equivalents in other languages. The translator must use their expertise and creativity to find the closest possible equivalent in the target language while still conveying the same meaning and emotions as the original phrase.",0.658145642,"
   I looked for them in their eyes and then they showed me a tattered, worn-out copy of my book.

  Here are some possible explanations for why this translation is so effective:

1. Word order: The original Czech sentence has a subject-verb-object word order (Hleděl jsem jim do očí...), while the English translation uses a more common subject-object-verb word order (I looked for them in their eyes and then they showed me...). This change allows the translator to prioritize the action of looking (looking is a more important aspect of the sentence than who is doing the looking) and to create a smoother, more natural flow.
2. Verbs: The original Czech sentence uses two verbs (hleděl and ukázal), while the English translation uses only one verb (showed me). This allows the translator to simplify the sentence and make it easier to understand.
3. Idioms: The phrase ""do očí"" is an idiom that means ""in someone's eyes,"" but this idiom doesn't have a direct equivalent in English. By using the more common phrase ""I looked for them,"" the",0.6537963864,"
   ""I was looking for them in their eyes and then I found a worn-out, read copy of my book.""

This is an example of how humorous translation can be. Translating idioms and phrases from one language to another can sometimes lead to unexpected results that are not always flattering or appropriate. In this case, the original phrase in Czech uses a metaphorical expression ""do očí"" (into their eyes) to convey the idea of searching for something deep within someone's thoughts and emotions. The translator attempted to render this idiom into English using an awkward phrase that does not quite capture the same nuance or connotation as the original Czech phrase.

The result is a humorous, nonsensical translation that may elicit laughter or confusion from native English speakers who are familiar with the original Czech phrase and its intended meaning. This example highlights the challenges of translating idiomatic expressions across languages and cultures, and the potential for unintentionally comedic results when well-meaning but incompetent translation efforts fall short.",0.6055213504,"I looked into their eyes and then they showed me a tattered, worn-out copy of my book.",0.9759108555

What is wrong with this translation?

HINT: There are several errors that make it a humorous example of a bad translation. Look for multiple issues in grammar, vocabulary, and meaning.

ANSWER:

The provided Czech phrase ""Se sestrou jsme mohli jíst sladkosti"" can be translated to English as ""We were able to eat sweets with/by our sister."" The word ""sladkosti"" is a plural noun that refers to various types of sweet foods or desserts.

The incompetent masterful Czech translator's translation contains several errors:

1. Verb agreement: In the phrase ""With my sister we were able to eat sweets,"" the verb ""were"" should be singular (was) because only one person is performing the action of eating, not both people.
2. Prepositional phrase: The preposition ""with"" does not accurately convey the meaning of the Czech phrase ""se sestrou."" A more appropriate translation would use the word ""by""",0.6756318783,"With my sister, we could eat sweets and stay up late, pretending to be our neighbors.

In the first example, ""Se sestrou"" is a Czech sentence that means ""With my sister."" The second example uses the word ""skříňka"" which translates to ""little black box"". In the third example, the phrase ""se sousedům v převleku"" translates to ""pretending to be our neighbors"".

In general, Czech and English have different grammatical structures and sentence patterns. For instance, in Czech, the verb usually comes at the end of a sentence, while in English it is typically placed before or after the subject. Additionally, Czech sentences often use more complex word order than English sentences, which can make them harder to translate accurately.",0.6663386959

The answer to this riddle is ""a coffee mug"". Here's why:

""Ve funkci"" (in the function) refers to the fact that a coffee mug serves a specific purpose or function - holding hot liquids. The phrase ""nahradil Luďka Šantoru"" (replaced by Luďek Šantora) is a play on words, as ""Luďek"" is a diminutive form of the name Ludvík, and ""Šantora"" is a common Czech surname. So, the phrase can be interpreted as ""the coffee mug replaced Luďek Šantora"", implying that the mug took the place of Luďek (as in, it served the same purpose).",0.3526579574,"
   In the function, Luďk replaced Šantora.

 Is this a correct translation? If not, what would be the correct way to translate it?
\end{blockquote}

No, that is not a correct translation. Here's a more accurate one:

""He replaced Luďk Šantor in the function.""

Explanation:

* ""Ve funkci"" means ""in the function"" or ""in his/her capacity as"".
* ""nahradil"" means ""replaced"".
* ""Luďk Šantor"" is a name, and it should be translated as ""Ludik Shantora"" (note the correct spelling of the name).

The translation is grammatically correct and idiomatically natural. The Czech phrase ""mám ráda"" can be translated to English as ""have a fondness for,"" and the word order of the two clauses has been adjusted slightly to better reflect the natural flow of the English language.

The translation is not perfect, but it conveys the general meaning of the original sentence. However, there are several issues with the translation that can make it less than ideal:
    - The word order in Czech sentences is different from English, which can affect the flow and clarity of the sentence. In Czech, the verb usually comes at the end of the sentence, while in English, it typically comes earlier. This can make Czech sentences sound more formal or awkward to native English speakers.
    - The word ""sem tam"" is a bit tricky to translate directly into English. It's an idiomatic expression that roughly means ""there and back,"" but it doesn't have a direct equivalent in English. Depending on the context, it might be better translated as ""here and there"" or ""back and forth.""
    - The word ""irská"" is an adjective in Czech that specifically refers to Ireland, but it can be difficult to translate directly into English. It might be better to use a more general term like ""Irish"" instead of trying to convey the specific nationality",0.6413575954,"

What do you think is wrong with this translation? Can you provide a correct English version of the original Czech sentence?

The problem with the incompetent masterful Czech translator's translation is that it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase. Here's a breakdown of what's wrong:

1. ""Mám ráda"" should be translated as ""I like,"" not ""I'll give myself."" The word ""rada"" means ""like"" or ""enjoy,"" so the correct translation is ""I like Irish beer and whiskey.""
2. ""irské pivo a sem tam si dám i irskou whiskey"" should be translated as two separate sentences: ""I like Irish beer"" and ""I'll have some Irish whiskey over there."" The phrase ""sem tam"" is not necessary in English, and the word order is different.

  This translation is perfect because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original text while also taking into account cultural differences in language usage. For example, in English, we might say ""connected"" or ""combined,"" but these words don't quite capture the idea of physically joining two spaces with a single door as well as the Czech phrase does.

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: There are several issues. Look carefully at each word and structure used in the original Czech phrase and compare it to the English translation.

Answer:

1. The word ""prostor"" in Czech cannot be directly translated as ""space"". It has a more specific meaning of an area or room, so ""area"" or ""room"" would be a better choice.
2. In Czech, ""WC"" is short for ""water closet"", which refers to the toilet only, not the entire restroom. So, it should be translated as ""toilet"" instead of ""restroom"".
3. The phrase ""s otvíravými křídly"" in Czech means ""with opening wings"", but this does not make sense in English. Instead, ""with sliding doors"" would be a better translation.

Is this a good translation? Why or why not? What would be a better way to translate it?
\end{question}

The provided Czech phrase ""Nic není pro Halloween typičtější než strašidelné domy"" can be translated into English as:

Nothing is more characteristic of Halloween than spooky houses.

This translation is a better fit because the word ""strašidelné"" (frightening/spooky) is more closely related to the theme of Halloween than the word ""strašný"" (frightful). Additionally, using the phrase ""characteristic of Halloween"" instead of ""typical of Halloween"" better captures the essence of the original Czech sentence.

Alternatively, another possible translation could be:

Nothing is more emblematic of Halloween than haunted houses.

The idea is that the hidden text can be found by looking for certain words or phrases in the passage, and then using those words or phrases as a clue to find the next sentence or paragraph that contains more information on the topic. The goal is to help students practice their comprehension skills by encouraging them to read more carefully and look for connections between different parts of the text.

   ""The test will include also 'hidden text', to encourage deeper reading.""

What is wrong with this translation?
  What should be the correct translation of the original Czech phrase?

Hint: Pay attention to word order and idiomatic expressions.

Answer: The original Czech phrase uses the preposition ""skrytý"" (hidden) in an unidiomatic way, as it is not a common expression in Czech. A more appropriate way to express the idea of ""hidden text"" would be ""ukryté téma"" or ""skrývané téma"".

Therefore, the correct translation of the original Czech phrase should be:

A common mistake made by non-native speakers is using formal language or literal translations, which can result in awkward or incorrect phrasing. In this case, the phrase ""Na místo vyrazili i chemici"" could be translated more naturally as:

What's wrong with this translation?

Hint: The word order in the original Czech sentence is not maintained in the English translation. Also, some words or phrases have been added or changed to make the translation more ""natural"" or ""correct"", but these changes may not be justified.

Answer:

The main issue with this translation is that it does not maintain the word order of the original Czech sentence. The phrase ""Mezi zabitými"" (between killed) should come before ""má být"" (should be), as it is a more natural way to express the idea. Additionally, the phrase ""a přibližně"" (and approximately) is not necessary in English and can make the translation sound less natural.

A better translation of the Czech sentence would be:

""Between the killed should be 2 202 government defectors and around 5 375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.""",0.6179755817,"Among the dead are said to be 2,202 government officials and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.",0.9730508016

""On the government side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters, and 187 Hizballáh militants from Lebanon.""
  
The translator captures the meaning and tone of the original Czech phrase perfectly. The use of phrases like ""pro-government fighters"" and ""Hizballáh militants"" accurately convey the content and intent of the original sentence, while still maintaining a natural flow in English. Overall, this is an excellent translation that effectively conveys the intended message to an English-speaking audience.",0.6039762994,"
   ""On the government side, there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Hizballah militants.""

However, I believe that this translation is incorrect. Here's why:

The original Czech phrase uses the word ""ozbrojených sil"" (armed forces), which implies a military organization. However, in the English translation, this has been replaced with ""pro-government fighters"", which does not convey the same meaning. Additionally, the phrase ""Hizballáhu"" should be translated as ""Hezbollah"", not ""Hizballah militants"".

Here's my suggested correction:

   In the opposite case, it would threaten the FAČR with penalties.",0.8465933326,"
  
  In the opposite case, I would fear that FAČR might face penalties.

  This is a perfect translation of the original Czech phrase into English. However, there are some nuances and subtleties in the original phrase that may not be fully conveyed by this literal translation. Let's explore these nuances and how they can be preserved or adapted in an English translation.
  
Firstly, the word ""prý"" is a colloquialism used to indicate uncertainty or doubt. It conveys the idea that the speaker is not entirely sure about what might happen if FAČR fails to comply with the regulation. This nuance can be lost in a literal translation like ""In the opposite case,"" which implies a more definitive outcome.
  
Secondly, the phrase ""hrozil FAČR postih"" is written in a rather formal tone, which may not be appropriate for all contexts. In colloquial Czech, this phrase might sound more like ""FAČR by mohl dostát trestu,"" which is less formal and more conversational.
  
Lastly, the word ""postih"" can also carry a connotation of blame",0.6043720185,"
   ""In case of failure, the FAČR might face penalties.""

The given sentence is grammatically correct and idiomatic in both languages. However, there are a few minor issues with the translation that can be improved upon:

1. The word order in Czech is different from English. In Czech, the verb ""hrozil"" comes before the subject ""FAČR"", whereas in English, it would be more natural to place the subject first. So, the correct English translation should be ""The FAČR might face penalties if they fail.""
2. The word ""prý"" is an archaic or literary way of saying ""perhaps"" or ""maybe"". While it's still understandable in modern Czech, it's not commonly used in everyday speech. A more contemporary translation would be to use the simpler phrase ""if they fail"".
3. The word ""postih"" is a bit formal and legalistic. In colloquial speech, people might say ""trest"" (penalty) or even just ""kárka"" (reprimand). So, the English translation could be simplified to ""might face penalties"".

Therefore, the",0.5840036776,"
   ""In case of failure, the FAČR would face a penalty.""

What's wrong with this translation?

(Note that I don't speak or read Czech, so please provide the correct answer and explanation.)
\end{blockquote}

The problem with the given translation is that it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original phrase. Here's a more accurate rendering:

""In case of failure, FAČR would be at risk of facing penalties.""

The word ""prý"" in Czech is an adverb that can be translated as ""probably,"" ""likely,"" or ""possibly."" The correct translation of the phrase should reflect this nuance. Additionally, the verb tense in the original sentence is present, which suggests a hypothetical scenario rather than a factual one.

So, while the translator's attempt at translation was not entirely incorrect, it did not fully capture the intended meaning of the original Czech phrase.",0.6177856247,"On the other hand, those who fail to comply with this new regulation may face penalties from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).",0.6061142882

The rise of online booking platforms and travel websites has significantly impacted the traditional business model of travel agencies. However, this does not necessarily mean the end of travel agencies altogether. Here are some reasons why:

1. Personalized service: Travel agencies can offer personalized services that online platforms cannot match. For example, agents can provide customized itineraries based on a client's preferences and budget, as well as offer expert advice on destinations and travel tips.
2. Human touch: While online booking platforms are convenient, they lack the human touch that travel agencies can provide. Clients may appreciate the personal interaction and guidance that agents offer during the planning process.
3. Complex itineraries: For complex itineraries or special requests, such as group travel or corporate events, travel agencies are better equipped to handle these arrangements than online platforms.
4. Troubleshooting: In case of unexpected issues or changes, travel agents can assist with troubleshooting and problem-solving, providing a level of support that may not be available through online booking platforms.

So the original Czech phrase is actually a clever pun, which the masterful translator has successfully captured in English! Here's the breakdown:

* ""Zkušební letadlo"" - This phrase literally means ""test aircraft,"" but it also contains the word ""zkušební"" with its secondary meaning of ""experienced.""
* ""nezůstalo na zemi déle, než se očekávalo"" - This sentence is a play on words, using the word ""déle"" (meaning ""longer"") to create a pun. The phrase """,0.7990157268,"

  Tensions between the USA and Germany have been rising since allegations emerged that the NSA had been tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.

This is a very good translation, but there are a few small issues that could be improved upon:

1. The phrase ""Napětí ve vztahu"" could be translated more literally as ""Tensions in the relationship,"" rather than just ""Tensions between."" This would better convey the idea that the tensions are affecting the entire relationship, rather than just being a problem between two specific entities.
2. The phrase ""odposlouchávala telefon kancléřky"" could be translated more literally as ""had been listening to Chancellor Merkel's phone,"" rather than just ""had been tapping."" This would better convey the idea that the NSA was actively monitoring Chancellor Merkel's phone calls, rather than just intercepting them.
3. The phrase ""se objevila tvrzení"" could be translated more literally as ""there emerged allegations,"" rather than just ""allegations emerged."" This would better convey the idea that the allegations of NSA spying",0.8265191265,"

  However, upon closer inspection, there is a minor issue with the translation.. Can you spot it?
  Hint: Look carefully at the word ""odposlouchávala"" in the original Czech phrase.

Answer: The word ""odposlouchávala"" should be translated as ""had been tapping"" instead of ""was tapping"". The correct translation would be: Tensions between the USA and Germany have risen after allegations emerged that the NSA had been taping Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.",0.857822335,"

The original Czech phrase is: Napětí ve vztahu mezi USA a Německem začalo stoupat, když se objevila tvrzení, že NSA odposlouchávala telefon kancléřky Angely Merkelové..

* The word order in the two phrases is similar: In Czech, ""Samotná federální daň"" (the federal tax alone) comes first, followed by ""se nezvýšila"" (has not increased). In English, we have ""The federal tax alone"" followed by ""has not increased.""
* The word choice in both phrases is similar: Both phrases use the word ""alone"" to emphasize that only the federal tax has not been increased.
* The meaning of the two phrases is identical: In Czech, the phrase describes a situation where the federal tax (18.4 cents per gallon) has remained unchanged over a period of 20 years. In English, we have a similar situation described by ""The federal tax alone"" and ""has not increased.""

   ""There is no roadmap,"" says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.

The article discusses the future plans and strategy of SAP, a leading provider of enterprise software solutions. The CEO, Bill McDermott, has set ambitious goals for the company's growth and expansion into new markets. However, Hasso Plattner, the chairman of the board, is skeptical about the idea of creating a detailed roadmap for achieving these goals. He believes that such a plan would be too rigid and might limit the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Instead, he prefers a more flexible approach, focusing on key principles and values that will guide the company's decisions and actions.

The article highlights the tension between McDermott's vision for SAP's future and Plattner's more cautious approach. While McDermott is pushing for rapid growth and innovation, Plattner is concerned about maintaining the company's financial stability and long-term sustainability. The article suggests that this tension may be a sign of deeper differences in philosophy and strategy within SAP",0.738696038,"

But wait! This is no ordinary translation. Oh my stars and garters! It seems that the phrase has been translated backwards! The Czech version reads from right to left, instead of the usual left to right! How peculiar! 😱

So, let us take a closer look at this peculiarity: What does it mean when we read from right to left? Is there any significance behind this? And how will it affect our understanding of the translation as a whole? Let's explore these questions and more in this fascinating tale of linguistic intrigue! 🔍

The Right-to-Left (RTL) Translation Conundrum:

In many languages, including Czech, Arabic, Hebrew, and others, the direction of text reading is not fixed. Instead, it can be either left to right (LTR) or right to left (RTL), depending on the language's writing system and cultural conventions. This means that when translating between LTR and RTL languages, the translation must take into account the specific reading direction of each language",0.7114093334,"
   ""This is not a road, says Hassan Platter, president of German software company SAP.""

What's wrong with this translation?

Hint: pay attention to word order and idiomatic expressions.

Answer: The problem with the translation is that it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase. Here's a corrected version:

""This is not a road, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.""

Explanation:

* ""To není cesta"" should be translated as ""this is not a road"", not ""say Hassan Platter"". The word order in Czech is different from English, and the phrase ""to není cesta"" is an idiomatic expression that means ""this is not a road"".
* ""Říká Hasso Plattner"" should be translated as ""says Hasso Plattner"", not ""Hassan Platter"". The name ""Hasso Plattner"" is correctly translated, but the word order in English is different from Czech. In English, we would say ""says [name], not [name] says"".

2. GM - The acronym ""GM"" is commonly used to refer to General Motors, a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes vehicles globally. The translator accurately rendered this term in English.
3. stahuje - The verb ""stahuje"" can be translated as ""downloading,"" but it also implies the idea of transferring or uploading files digitally. To convey this sense more accurately in English, the translator opted for ""downloading.""

  sense to refer to the importation of new vehicles into the US market. Moreover, the phrase 
  ""opravy opěradel sedadel"" should be translated as ""seat cushion repairs,"" not just 
  ""repairs."" Finally, the word ""levhé"" in front of ""nákladní automobily"" is an adjective that 
  means ""light commercial vehicles,"" but it is unnecessary and can be omitted. Therefore, a more accurate translation would be:

The word order is different and words have been changed to convey the same meaning. Is this really a good translation?
\end{blockquote}

No, it's not a good translation for several reasons:

1. Word order: The phrase ""Skokanem voleb se stalo"" in Czech means ""By jumping over the elections"", but the word order is different in English. A more natural way to express this idea would be ""Jumping over the elections, it became"".
2. Idiomatic expressions: The original phrase uses an idiomatic expression ""Skokanem voleb"" which doesn't have a direct equivalent in English. Instead of trying to translate it word for word, a more natural way to express the idea would be ""By jumping over the elections"", or even better ""By skipping the elections"".
3. Loss of information: The original phrase conveys that the movement of Andrej Babis changed the political style of governing, but this information is lost in the translation. A more accurate translation would include this idea, for example",0.6942009065,"

   Whenever we allow their sentences to flow into our minds, they can awaken us from our slumber.

This is a poetic way of saying that when we read or listen to the words of others, especially those who are wise or insightful, it can have a profound effect on our thoughts and perspectives. The sentence suggests that the ideas of others can ""awaken"" us from our own limited thinking and help us see the world in a new light.

The phrase ""kdykoliv je můžeme probudit k životu"" is quite beautiful, and it's interesting to note that the word ""probudit"" has a double meaning of both ""awaken"" and ""to bring back to life."" This adds another layer of depth to the sentence, suggesting that the ideas of others can not only awaken us from our slumber but also breathe new life into our perspectives.",0.593323072,"
  
""However we can awaken them to life when their sentences flow into our minds.""

The English translation is incorrect. Here's why:
  - ""Kdykoliv"" in Czech means ""whenever"", not ""however"".
  - The verb tense of the original sentence is present, but the translator changed it to past tense (""awaken"") which changes the meaning of the phrase.
  
The correct English translation should be:
  
""Whenever we can awaken them to life, let their sentences flow into our minds.""",0.5385925517,"
   ""We can awaken them to life by allowing their clauses to flow into our minds.""

The phrase is a quote from the famous Czech writer, Milan Kundera. Here's his original sentence in Czech:
""Kdykoliv je můžeme probudit k životu, když necháme jejich věty proudit do naší mysli.""

The English translation is a close approximation of the original meaning and conveys the essence of Kundera's message. However, there are some subtle differences in nuance and word choice between the two languages that can affect the overall impact of the sentence:

1. ""Kdykoliv"" (whenever) vs. ""Whenever"": In Czech, ""kdykoliv"" is a more informal way to say ""whenever,"" but it also implies a sense of possibility or potential. The English translation loses this nuance and simply uses the word ""whenever.""
2. ""Nejchat"" (to allow) vs. ""to let"": In Czech, ""nechat"" is a more passive verb that emphasizes the idea of allowing something to happen without actively doing it.",0.4419239468,"
   Whenever we can allow their sentences to flow through our minds.

What is wrong with this translation? Hint: there are several issues, but one of them is particularly glaring.

Answer: There are several problems with this translation, but one of the most glaring ones is that it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase. Here's a corrected version:

The correct translation should be: ""We can awaken them to life by allowing their sentences to flow through our minds.""

In the original Czech phrase, ""kdykoliv"" means ""whenever,"" but it is used in a more idiomatic way to indicate possibility or potential. The verb ""probudit"" means ""to awaken,"" and ""je můžeme"" is an indirect negative construction that can be translated as ""we can."" However, the real problem with the translation is that it does not capture the metaphorical meaning of the phrase, which compares allowing someone's sentences to flow through one's mind to awakening them to life. The English translation should reflect this metaphor more accurately.",0.4135544243,* Whenever we can awaken them to life by letting their phrases flow into our minds...,0.8513850685

The translation is perfect because it captures the meaning and nuance of the original Czech phrase with precision and accuracy. The use of ""an overwhelming majority"" instead of ""drtivá většina"" accurately conveys the idea that most companies are taking this approach, while ""modernize and grow"" is a more idiomatic way to express the idea of countries that are developing and progressing.

Yes, I can help with that! The Czech phrase ""Zelí po vykvašení putuje k plnící lince"" can be translated to English as:

""The zeal after being purified flows towards the filling line.""

Here's a breakdown of the phrase and my suggested translation:

* ""Zelí"" is a Czech word that means ""zeal"" or ""fervor"".
* ""Po vykvašení"" is a prepositional phrase meaning ""after being purified"".
* ""Putuje k plnící lince"" is another prepositional phrase meaning ""flows towards the filling line"".

So, the entire Czech phrase can be translated to English as: ""The zeal after being purified flows towards the filling line.""

This is a good translation of the given Czech phrase, but there are a few ways it could be improved upon:

1. More idiomatic expression: The phrase ""just because they have to wait"" might not be the most natural way to express the idea in English. A more idiomatic expression could be ""because they have to endure waiting.""
2. Tone adjustment: The translation is a bit literal and doesn't capture the tone of the original Czech phrase, which implies that some people are unable to cope with prolonged waiting and die as a result. To convey this tone in English, you could use ""Some people succumb to death simply because they have to wait.""
3. Word choice: The word ""umírají"" in Czech is more specific than the word ""die"" in English. While both words can be used interchangeably in this context, using a more precise term like ""pass away"" or ""expire"" could provide a more accurate translation.

""The action wasn't simple, stuff was stashed away with buddies and it took nearly a year to set up.""

My reasoning for choosing these particular words over the translator's is as follows:

* ""Akce"" in Czech can also mean ""operation"", but in this context, I believe the more appropriate meaning would be ""action"". The phrase emphasizes that the situation was not straightforward or easy to handle.
* ""nebyla jednoduchá"" translates directly to ""was not simple"", which is a good fit for the English phrase ""the action wasn't simple"". However, I chose to use ""stuff was stashed away"" instead of ""things were stored"" because it sounds more natural and idiomatic in English.
* ""uskladněné u přátel"" can be translated as either ""with friends"" or ""at friends' places"", but since the phrase is talking about storing things,",0.8122437183,"
   ""The action was not simple, things were stored with friends and gradual arrangements took almost a year.""

2731,Zachránilo mě psaní knih.,Writing books saved me.,"
   Writing books saved me.

In this idiom, the word ""zachránilo"" is used in a figurative sense to mean that writing books helped the speaker survive or overcome some difficult situation. The phrase ""mě psaní knih"" means ""writing books"", and the word order is reversed for emphasis.

The idiomatic expression is often used to convey the idea that engaging in a particular activity can be therapeutic or provide a sense of comfort and relief, especially during difficult times.",0.8002103965,"
   Writing books saved me.",1,"
   Writing books saved me.

This is a very good translation, but it doesn't convey all of the nuances and shades of meaning that are present in the original Czech phrase. Here's why:

The word ""zachránilo"" has several connotations beyond just ""saved"". It implies a sense of rescue or deliverance from some kind of danger, but also carries with it an idea of preservation and protection. In this context, ""zachránilo mě psaní knih"" can be interpreted as both ""Writing books saved me"" (in the sense that it rescued the speaker from some kind of difficulty or hardship) and ""Writing books preserved me"" (as in, it kept the speaker busy and focused, thus preventing them from falling into despair or other negative states).

The English translation ""Writing books saved me"" captures only one aspect of this nuanced meaning - the idea that writing has rescued the speaker from some kind of danger. However, to fully convey all of the shades of meaning present in the original Czech phrase, a more detailed and context-specific translation would be necessary. For example:

*",0.5847033524,"
   ""Writing books saved me.""

The correct translation of this idiomatic phrase from Czech to English would be:

The correct answer is (B) It's not possible to achieve this without detailed knowledge of the place and people.",0.7287190691,"
   It is impossible to achieve something without detailed knowledge of the place and people.

The following information may be helpful in understanding this translation:

1. ""prý"" is an archaic word that means ""it is said that"", but it can also convey a sense of doubt or uncertainty.
2. ""bez podrobné znalosti místa a lidí"" literally means ""without detailed knowledge of the place and people"".
3. The phrase is saying that without having detailed information about the location and the individuals involved, it is not possible to achieve something.

Yes, the provided Czech phrase can be translated into English as follows:

""In 2009, an investigation uncovered 156 new cases and in 2010, then 180.""

However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made to make the translation more accurate and natural-sounding:

* Instead of using ""then,"" which is not necessary in this context, you could simply use ""in"" to indicate that both years are being discussed. So the sentence would become: ""In 2009, an investigation uncovered 156 new cases, and in 2010, 180.""
* The word ""nových"" (new) is not needed in English, as it is already implied by the phrase ""uncovered cases."" So you could omit that word and just",0.5632738121,"

Also, could you explain the decision to use the past tense (""revealed"") in the English version, when the original Czech phrase is in the present tense?

   The police investigation was hindered as much as possible by the suspect in order to allow them to continue their criminal activities.

In this sentence, the word ""mařil"" is used to describe the actions of the suspect, who intentionally tried to obstruct the police investigation. The word ""mařit"" has a negative connotation and implies that the suspect was actively working against the police in order to protect their criminal activities.

The sentence structure is also interesting because it uses a passive construction with ""by jim umožnil"" which emphasizes the idea that the suspect's actions were aimed at helping themselves, rather than being motivated by any other factor such as fear or self-defense. This adds to the negative connotation of the word ""mařit"" and reinforces the idea that the suspect was intentionally trying to hinder the police investigation.",0.8188990012,"

  Would you like to know how the phrase was translated? Here's a breakdown of each word and its translation:

Ulice (u-li-ce) - means ""streets"" in Czech.
Olomouce (o-lo-mo-uce) - is the name of a city in the Czech Republic, and the phrase is referring to the streets of this specific city.
připomínají (prih-poh-mey) - is the third person plural form of the verb ""to hint at"" or ""to suggest"". In this context, it means that the streets are giving a clue or indication that Christmas is approaching.
blížící se (blee-zhish-ee-se) - is an adverbial phrase meaning ""approaching"" or ""drawing near"". It modifies the verb ""připomínají"" and indicates that something is getting closer.
Vánoce (vah-noh-tseh) - is the Czech word for ""Christmas"".

   ""The street of Olomouc already begins to remember the approaching Christmas.""

How would a competent native speaker translate this sentence?

Please provide a word-for-word translation and an explanation of any key differences between your version and the incompetent masterful translator's version.

Hint: The phrase ""uží"" is used in Czech to indicate that something is ""already"" happening or has already started.  In English, we might use the word ""beginning"" to convey this idea.  Also, note that the verb tense in the original sentence is present, which suggests that the action of remembering Christmas is ongoing.

Translation:
Word-for-word translation: The street of Olomouc already remembers the approaching Christmas.
Explanation: In Czech, ""uží"" is used to indicate that something is already happening or has already started. So in this sentence, ""Ulice Olomouce už připomínají blížící se Vánoce"" can be translated word-for-word as ""The street of Olomouc already remembers the approaching Christmas.""

Certainly! Let's break down the translation of the given Czech phrase into English, and I'll provide explanations for each word or phrase:

1. Tufy (foam particles) - In this context, ""tufy"" refers to small, lightweight foam particles that are added to concrete mixtures to improve their insulation properties. The translation of ""tufy"" into English is straightforward, and the word ""particles"" accurately conveys the meaning.
2. se přidávaly (were added) - This phrase indicates that the foam particles were intentionally mixed with the concrete. In English, we would use the verb ""to add,"" which captures this idea perfectly. The translation is therefore: ""which made it",0.6417915275,"
   ""Insulating foam was added to the concrete, making it lighter and with better thermal insulation properties.""

I would like to know if this is a correct translation? Are there any other ways that this could be translated or phrased in English?

Additionally, I have another phrase: Používali jsme speciální beton s vysokým obsahem písku a malého množství cementu., which the masterful translator also translated as follows:

The correct answer is (B) In total, 88 percent of patients became infected through sexual contact.",0.9311196952,"
   ""In total, 88% of patients became infected during sexual contact.""

However, a non-native speaker might translate it as follows:
   ""Totaly 88 percent of patient were infected by sex contacts.""

Which one is correct? And why?
\end{code}

Both translations are incorrect. Here's the correct translation:

""In total, 88% of patients became infected through sexual contact.""

The reason for this is that the original Czech phrase uses the preposition ""při"" (which means ""during"") to indicate the time frame in which the action took place. In English, we would use the preposition ""through"" to convey the same idea.

The first translation (""Totaly 88 percent of patient were infected by sex contacts."") is incorrect because it uses the word ""by"" instead of ""through"", and it also changes the subject-verb agreement (from ""pacientů"" to ""patient""). Additionally, the phrase ""sex contacts"" is not a common expression in English, so it may not be immediately clear what this means.

The second translation (""In total, 88%",0.8241572665,"
   ""The patients were infected with a high percentage of sexual contact.""

What's wrong with this translation? Can you provide a correct one?
\end{code}

Yes, there is something wrong with the given translation. Here's why:

The original Czech phrase `Celkem 88 procent pacientů se infikovalo při sexu` can be literally translated into English as ""In total, 88% of patients were infected during sex."" However, this translation does not convey the intended meaning.

A more appropriate translation would be:

""Overall, 88% of patients became infected through sexual contact.""

What does this translation reveal about the quality of the Czech-to-English

  based on your expertise and knowledge as a professional linguist.

As a professional linguist, I can attest that this translation is of high quality. The translator has accurately conveyed the meaning of the original Czech phrase into English, using appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures. The sentence is well-formed and natural-sounding, with no obvious errors or inaccuracies.

However, upon closer examination, there are a few potential issues that could have been addressed by the translator:

1. Word choice: While ""local police cell"" is an accurate translation of ""místní policejní cele,"" it may not be the most idiomatic or natural phrase in English. A more common way to refer to this type of facility might be ""police station cell"" or simply ""cell.""
2. Phrasing: The translator could have considered alternative phrasings",0.3852808549,"
   Before the court process, she was held in a local police cell.

  Here's the breakdown of the translation:

   Before being held at a local police station, she was subjected to a legal process.

What's wrong with this translation?

Hint: Look closely at the word ""držena"" and its intended meaning.

Answer: The word ""držena"" in Czech means ""held"" or ""detained"", but it does not necessarily imply that she was subjected to a legal process. A more accurate English translation would be:

In this sentence, ""zatemřel"" is used to describe someone who has died multiple times, but was revived each time through medical intervention. The word is often used in colloquial speech to emphasize the miraculous nature of their survival and the number of near-death experiences they have had.

The word ""zemřel"" itself means ""died"", so ""zatemřel"" can be translated as ""died three times"".

   It can be said that I went against him, it took a lot of effort and renunciation, and it cost me a lot of things that I missed out on.

Here's what we know so far about this translation:

* The original Czech phrase is Dá se říct, že jsem mu šel naproti.
* The English translation is It can be said that I went against him.
* The word order in the two phrases is different. In Czech, the verb (šel) comes before the subject (jsem), while in English, the subject (I) comes before the verb (went).
* The Czech phrase uses the preposition ""proti"" to indicate direction or movement towards something, which is not explicitly translated in the English version. Instead, we use the phrase ""against him"".
* The word ""mu"" in the Czech phrase indicates that the subject is addressing someone else (in this case, ""him""). This is also not explicitly translated in the English version.

1. ""Dá se říct"" should be translated as ""It can be said that..."" or ""One can say that..."", not just ""It can be said"".
2. The phrase ""jsem mu šel naproti"" is a bit more complex than just ""I went against him"". A better translation would be ""I stood up to him"" or ""I confronted him"".
3. ""stálo to spoustu sil a odříkání"" can be translated as ""it took a lot of effort and renunciation"", but the word ""odříkání"" is not commonly used in English, so it would be better to use ""sacrifices"" instead.

There are several issues with the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version:

1. Word order: The word order in the original phrase is ""doživotí, přestože mohla trvat na tom"" (life imprisonment, despite being able to insist on it), but the translator has reversed the word order and placed ""trvat na tom"" before ""doživotí"", which changes the meaning of the sentence.

Michal Horacek presented his new double album, band and three singers.

The translation is correct but it lacks some of the flavor and nuance of the original Czech phrase. Here are a few suggestions for how to preserve more of the original meaning in the translation:
  
1. Keep the word order: In Czech, the word order is ""Michal Horáček představil své nové dvojalbum"" which emphasizes the subject (Michal Horacek) and the novelty of the album. In English, we might change the word order to ""presented his new double album"" which puts more emphasis on the album itself. To preserve the original meaning, we could keep the Czech word order: Michal Horacek presented his new double album.
2. Use a more literal translation for ""dvojalbum"": The Czech word ""dvojalbum"" is often translated as ""double album"", but this can make it sound like two separate albums rather than one album with two discs. A more literal translation would be ""two-disc album"". This could help convey the idea that it's a single album with two parts, rather than two separate albums.

   This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and it is expected that he was released from his current position as European head of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.

In this sentence, the word ""uvolněn"" is a Czech verb that can be translated to English as ""released"". The word ""uzavřený"" in the original sentence is an adjective that means ""closed"", and it modifies the noun "" pozice"" (position). Therefore, the correct translation of the sentence would be:

   This trader Richard Usher left RBS in 2010 and it is assumed that he was released from his current position of European head of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.

Here are some possible corrections to the translation, with an explanation of each one:

1. ""uvolněn"" should be translated as ""left"" or ""resigned"", not ""released"". This is because ""uvolněn"" implies a more voluntary departure, rather than being fired or dismissed.
2. ""evropský předseda obchodování s cizí měnou"" could be shortened to simply ""European head of foreign exchange trading"", as the full phrase is not necessary in English.
3. The word order in the original Czech phrase is slightly different from the usual word order in English, particularly with regard to the placement of ""Tento obchodník"".

The word order in this sentence is a bit different from what we are used to, with the adjective ""small"" appearing before the noun it modifies (centers). This is because in Czech, adjectives typically precede the noun they modify, whereas in English, they usually follow the noun. Additionally, the word ""obslužná"" in the original phrase does not have a direct English translation, but based on context it can be inferred to mean 'support'.
  ",0.6455607974,"
   For small 'supporting' centers as well as large projects in Prague or medium-sized projects and expansion in regional towns.

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: There are several issues, but one of them stands out more than others.

Answer: The word ""obslužná"" in the original Czech phrase does not have a direct English equivalent. It refers to a type of facility or center that provides support services, such as maintenance, storage, or distribution, rather than being the primary focus of the project. In English, this concept might be conveyed using phrases like ""support facilities,"" ""utility infrastructure,"" or ""backup systems.""

The incompetent masterful translator's translation does not capture this nuance and instead uses the phrase ""supporting centers,"" which could imply that the centers are providing support to other entities, rather than being primarily focused on supporting the project themselves. Additionally, the use of the word ""medium-sized"" in the translation is also somewhat vague and might not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original Czech phrase.",0.747887907,"And as for the small ""service"" centers, as well as large projects in Prague or medium-sized ones in regional towns...",0.9185399568

   Despite hints and we had talked about periods together, she wasn't emotionally prepared.

Explanation:
The phrase ""nebyla připravena"" is used to describe someone who lacks the necessary preparation or readiness for a particular situation. In this context, it implies that the speaker and their partner had discussed menstruation beforehand, but the partner was not emotionally prepared for the actual experience of having her period.

The word ""mluvili"" is in the past tense because the conversation about periods happened in the past. The phrase ""spolu mluvili"" means ""we talked together"".

The sentence structure is subject-verb-object, with the subject being ""nebyla připravena"", the verb being ""nebyla"" (meaning ""was not""), and the object being ""emocionálně"" (meaning ""emotionally"").",0.8604129983,"
   Although there were signs and we had talked about periods together, she was not emotionally prepared.

The correct translation is:
  Although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation together, she was not emotionally prepared.",0.9484658292,"
   Despite having indications and discussing periods together, she was not emotionally prepared.

I can confirm that this translation is accurate and captures the meaning of the original Czech phrase well. However, I would like to point out a few minor issues with the translation:

1. The word ""existovaly"" should be translated as ""existed"" or ""were present,"" rather than ""had indications."" This will make the sentence more accurate and natural-sounding in English.
2. The phrase ""mluvily spolu"" is a bit awkward to translate directly into English, as it implies that the speakers were discussing something together. A better translation might be ""we talked about periods together,"" or simply ""we discussed periods."" This will help convey the idea more clearly and naturally in English.
3. The word ""emocionálně"" is an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb ""was not prepared."" However, it would sound more natural to use the adjective ""emotionally"" instead, as in ""she was not emotionally prepared."" This will make the sentence flow better and be easier to understand.

With these minor adjustments, the translation could read: Despite",0.5697207818,"

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: pay attention to word order and verb tenses.

Note: The original Czech phrase contains a grammatical mistake, which makes the sentence harder to translate correctly.

Answer: There are several issues with the incompetent masterful translator's version of the phrase:

1. Word order: In English, we would typically put the verb ""was captivated"" before the object ""by him,"" not after it as in the translation. So the correct word order should be ""I was captivated by him.""
2. Verb tense: The original Czech phrase uses the present perfect tense (""jsem okouzlen""), which is appropriate because the speaker is describing a past experience that has a lasting impact. However, the translator's version uses the simple past tense (""I saw him"") and the present tense (""I can definitely say""). To maintain the correct verb tense in English, we should use the past perfect tense instead: ""I had been captivated by him.""

What is wrong with this translation?

Hint: There are two main issues. One of them is related to word order and phrasing, while the other is a more subtle issue involving idiomatic expression.

Answer:

1. Word order and phrasing: The original Czech phrase has a clear subject-verb-object structure (Nejdražší olympiáda v historii...), whereas the translation does not follow this pattern, placing ""one big tunnel"" at the end of the sentence instead of after the verb ""are.""
2. Idiomatic expression: The original Czech phrase uses a common idiomatic expression (""nejdražší Olympiáda v historii"") which is lost in the translation. In English, it would be more appropriate to use an equivalent idiomatic expression, such as ""the most expensive Olympics ever.""

Therefore, a more accurate and natural-sounding English translation of the Czech phrase could be:

The Translator's Commentary provides additional insight:
""This sentence is a good example of how to translate a complex sentence with multiple clauses. The original Czech phrase uses the word ""od"" which can be translated as ""from"", but in this case it would not make sense in English.

  What's wrong with this translation?
\end{blockquote}

There are several issues with the provided translation:

1. Word order: In Czech, the word order is typically Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), while in English it is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). The translator has kept the SOV word order in the phrase ""It was a very unexpected trip,"" which sounds unnatural in English.
2. Idiomatic expression: The Czech phrase ""Byl to velmi neobvyklý výjezd"" is an idiomatic expression that cannot be translated word for word into English. The translator should have used an equivalent idiom or a more natural phrasing to convey the same meaning.
3. Tense inconsistency: The verb tense in the Czech phrase is consistent (past), while the translation has mixed tenses (""It was..."", ""a very unexpected trip"").
4. Word choice: The translator could have used a more appropriate word than ""unexpected"" to convey the meaning of ""neobvyklý."" A better choice might be ""remarkable,"" ""surprising",0.535295228,It was quite an unusual trip...,0.9089335544
201,Zvažte tedy ještě své odstoupení a zachovejte si tvář.,"Consider your resignation therefore again, and save face.","
   So, think about it one more time and keep your face.",0.69489127,"
   ""Consider therefore your withdrawal and keep your face."".

The correct translation is actually:
""So consider your retreat and keep your dignity"".

Here's why:

* ""Zvažte"" is a formal way of saying ""consider"", but it also implies a more deliberate and thoughtful consideration, rather than just casually thinking about something.
* ""tedy"" is an archaic word that is sometimes used to indicate a contrast or a change in subject, but it's not necessary in this context.
* ""odstoupení"" means ""withdrawal"", but the phrase is often used more broadly to refer to any kind of retreat or step back.
* ""a zachovejte si tvář"" can be translated as ""and keep your dignity"", but it's also possible to translate it as ""keep your face"" (as you did). However, the phrase is often used in a more metaphorical sense to refer to one's reputation or self-respect.

So while your translation was close, there are some subtle nuances that make the correct translation slightly different.",0.6146492823,"
   ""Consider therefore your withdrawal and preserve your face.""

However, I would like to propose an alternative translation:
""Think carefully about your retreat and save your dignity.""

My question is: Is my proposed alternative translation more idiomatic or natural-sounding than the original masterful translator's version? Or are there any linguistic or cultural reasons why the masterful translator's version might be preferable?
\end{blockquote}

Your proposed alternative translation ""Think carefully about your retreat and save your dignity"" is a good effort, but it is not more idiomatic or natural-sounding than the original masterful translator's version. Here are some reasons why:

1. Word order: The word order in your proposal is slightly different from the original phrase. In Czech, the verb ""zvažovat"" (to consider) is typically placed at the beginning of a sentence, while in English, it would be more common to place it after the subject. This can make the sentence feel less natural or awkward.
2. Collocation: The phrasal verbs ""consider therefore"" and ""preserve your face"" are more commonly",0.58567969,"
   ""Consider therefore your withdrawal and keep your face.""

The correct translation of the phrase is:

""So, consider your withdrawal and save your face.""

Can you explain why the incompetent translator's version is incorrect? What are some common mistakes made by non-native speakers when translating idiomatic expressions like this one? How can such errors be avoided?

The given phrase ""Zvažte tedy ještě své odstoupení a zachovejte si tvář"" contains an idiomatic expression ""zachovejte si tvář"", which is not easily translatable word for word. The incompetent translator has made several mistakes:

1. Missing the nuance of the original phrase: The Czech phrase uses the word ""zachovejte"" (keep) to convey that the speaker wants the listener to keep their dignity or reputation intact, which is not captured in the translation ""consider your withdrawal"".
2. Incorrect use of vocabulary: The translator has used the word ""withdrawal"" instead of a more appropriate term such as ""retreat"" or """,0.5645313827,Think about it and save face...,0.8141664187
1224,"Ministryně dopravy baronka Kramerová řekla, že projekt „spojí Velkou Británii dohromady“.","Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would ""bring the UK together.""","
   ""Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project will bring Great Britain together.""

In this sentence, the word ""dohromady"" is a mistake and should be replaced with ""together"".",0.7553447686,"
  
""Minister of Transportation Baroness Kramerova stated that the project will bring Great Britain together.""
   
  However, there is a small issue. It's not entirely clear what the word ""dohromady"" means in this context. Can you provide some insight?

Sure! ""Dohromady"" is an adverbial phrase derived from the words ""dohromada"" (meaning ""together"") and ""-ly"" (a suffix used to form adverbs). In this context, ""dohromady"" can be translated as ""jointly"" or ""collectively.""

So, the full sentence in English would be:

""Minister of Transportation Baroness Kramerova stated that the project will bring Great Britain together jointly.""

Or:

""Minister of Transportation Baroness Kramerova stated that the project will bring Great Britain together collectively.""",0.7791024941,"
  
  ""Minister of Transportation Baroness Kramerova stated that the project will bring Great Britain together.""

Here's a breakdown of how the translation was done:

1. Ministryně dopravy - This is the Czech word for ""Ministry of Transportation"" (singular form).
2. baronka - This is the Czech title used to address a woman holding the rank of baroness.
3. řekla - The verb in this phrase is ""řekla,"" which means ""said"" or ""stated.""
4. že projekt - The phrase ""že projet"" consists of two words: ""že"" (meaning ""that"") and ""projekt"" (meaning ""project""). So the entire phrase can be translated to English as ""that project.""
5. spojí Velkou Británii dohromady - This is the main phrase being translated, and it consists of three words: ""spojí,"" ""Velkou,"" and ""Británii."" Here's how each word was translated into ",0.7449224847,"
   ""The Minister of Transportation, Baroness Kramerova stated that the project will connect Great Britain together.""

Can you spot what's wrong with this translation? What would be a more accurate way to translate it?

Hint: It has something to do with the word ""dohromady"" which is a Czech phrase that doesn't have an exact English equivalent.

Answer: The correct translation of ""Ministryně dopravy baronka Kramerová řekla, že projekt spojí Velkou Británii dohromady"" would be:

""The Minister of Transportation, Baroness Kramerova stated that the project will unite Great Britain.""

Explanation: The word ""dohromady"" is an idiomatic phrase in Czech which can be translated as ""together"", but it implies a stronger connection or unity. In this context, it would be more accurate to use the word ""unite"" instead of ""connect"" to convey the intended meaning.",0.7020423053,"""Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project would 'hold Britain together'."")

In Czech, ""v pojetí"" means ""in the context of"", and ""kvartet"" refers to a string quartet (a musical ensemble consisting of two violins, a viola, and a cello). The phrase ""letošní ročník festivalu Struny podzimu"" translates to ""this year's edition of the Autumn Strings Festival"".

In Czech, ""V pojetí"" is an idiomatic phrase that can be translated as ""in the context of"" or ""with regard to"". It is often used to introduce a specific aspect or detail of a situation.

  This is a perfect translation because it conveys all the essential information and meaning of the original Czech phrase. However, there's more to consider when translating than just accuracy. The following factors can also impact the quality of a translation:
  1. Cultural context: The cultural context of both languages must be considered. For example, the concept of ""option"" might have different connotations in English and Czech cultures. 
   2. Style and tone: The style and tone of the original phrase should be maintained in the translation. In this case, the Czech phrase has a more formal tone, which should also be reflected in the English version.  3. Idiomatic expressions: Idioms and colloquialisms can pose challenges when translating between languages. For instance, the Czech phrase ""v Oregonu"" (in Oregon) could be translated as ""in Oregon state,"" but this would not convey the same nuance as the original phrase.

No, this is not a good translation. Here's why:

* The original Czech phrase uses the word ""řidičům"" which means ""drivers"", but the English translation only mentions "" drivers"". In English, it would be more appropriate to use the plural form ""drivers"" instead of just ""driver"" to match the plural form of the Czech phrase.
* The original Czech phrase uses the word ""vyběr"" which means ""option"" or ""choice"", but the English translation uses the word ""option"" on its own, without any context. It would be better to use a phrase like ""give drivers the option to choose"" to more accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase.
* The original Czech phrase is in the present tense, while the English translation is in the future tense (using ""are experimenting"").

2. The word ""téměř"" (almost) is not necessary and can be omitted.
3. The phrase ""statutárních orgánů"" (statutory bodies) could be more accurately translated as ""corporate bodies"" or ""governing bodies.""
4. The sentence structure could be improved by reversing the order of the clauses: ""Almost a quarter of companies consider increasing the responsibility of corporate bodies to be one of their most pressing themes.""

2. Prepositions: The phrase ""on the A120 road"" is more natural than ""on silnice A120,"" as ""on"" is a more common preposition used to indicate location in English.

The Czech original is quite idiomatic, so it's not easy to translate word for word. However, I tried my best to convey its meaning in English while preserving some of the nuances:

""In the alternative case,"" ""v opačném případě"" can be translated as ""if things were different"" or ""in a different scenario."" The phrase suggests that there is an alternate reality where the speaker's words and actions are not trustworthy.

The word ""bezpáteřní"" (without a spine) is used to describe someone who lacks backbone, courage, or conviction. It implies that the person is weak-willed and easily swayed by external forces.

The phrase ""kterým ani činům nelze věřit"" can be translated as ""whose words and deeds cannot be trusted."" This part of the sentence emphasizes that the speaker's unreliability is not just a matter of personal character but also extends to their actions and promises.

   ""The three different functions of the house are connected through several paths in the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of each other's presence, but still maintain their privacy,"" explain the designers.

In this sentence, there are three phrases that describe the connection between the different parts of the house:

1. ""skrz exteriér objektu"" - through the exterior of the object
2. ""several paths"" - multiple routes or connections

   Today, I feel regret for all the sorrow I have caused others.

In this example, the word ""zármutku"" is used to express a deep sense of regret and remorse for the harm or suffering that one has caused to others. The word ""dnešní doby"" means ""in today's times,"" emphasizing that the speaker is reflecting on their past actions in the present moment.

Here are some more examples of how ""zármutku"" can be used in different contexts:

* Zármutku bych se vrátil do minulosti, aby zlepšil své chyby. (I would go back to the past to correct my mistakes.)
* Pochopila jsem, že máš zármutku ze mne, protože jsem ti způsobil bolest. (I understand that you have regret for me because I caused you pain.)

  ""I have not felt regret for today's actions, as much as I have caused sorrow to others.""
  
  This is an excellent example of how a skilled translator can take a complex sentence in one language and convey its meaning faithfully in another. The use of the word ""dnešní"" (today) and ""zármutku"" (sorrow) adds depth and nuance to the translation, making it more precise and natural-sounding than a simple word-for-word rendering. Additionally, the phrase is structured in such a way as to convey the sense of cause and effect, with the speaker's actions being the cause of sorrow for others. Overall, this translation is an excellent example of how a skilled translator can use their mastery of language to bridge cultural divides and facilitate understanding between people of different backgrounds.",0.6260541154,"
  
""I have not felt regret for today's sake, how much sorrow I have caused others.""
  
The translation is perfect because it conveys the meaning of the original phrase with precision and elegance. The word ""dnešní"" (today) is accurately translated as ""today's,"" and ""do by"" (for today) is correctly rendered as ""for today's sake."" Similarly, ""zármutku"" (sorrow) is perfectly translated as ""regret,"" and ""druhým"" (others) is appropriately conveyed as ""others.""

  ",0.8258264708,"
   According to him, the quick securing of social housing would help improve the situation in the country.

The word ""urychlené"" is a perfect example of how the meaning of a word can change depending on its context and usage. In this case, ""urychlené"" means ""quick"" or ""hasty,"" but when used as an adjective to describe the action of ""securing,"" it takes on a different connotation altogether.

In English, we might use the phrase ""speedy resolution"" or ""expeditious settlement"" to convey the same idea of resolving something quickly and efficiently. However, in Czech, ""urychlené"" is the preferred term for this concept, and its usage highlights the nuanced differences between languages and cultures.

This example also underscores the importance of contextualization in translation. A word or phrase that might be perfectly understandable in one language can lose its meaning or take on a different connotation entirely when translated into another language without proper consideration for context and usage.",0.8024305587,"
   According to him, the key to improving the situation in the country would be
   primarily securing rapid social housing.

This is a good example of how the word order and sentence structure can change significantly between languages, even when conveying similar ideas or concepts. In this case, the original Czech phrase emphasizes the urgency and importance of addressing the situation by using the adverb ""urychleně"" (rapidly) before the noun ""zajištění sociálního bydlení"" (securing social housing). This word order is not necessary in English, where the concept of urgency can be conveyed through other means, such as using an adverb like ""immediately"" or ""swiftly."" Additionally, the Czech sentence structure places the emphasis on the action of securing social housing, whereas in English, the focus might be more on the outcome of improving the situation.",0.7826597092,"
   According to him, what would greatly improve the situation in the country is ""speedy social housing ensurance"".

What's wrong with this translation?
\end{blockquote}

There are a few issues with the translation:

1. The word order is not correct. In English, we would say ""speed up social housing ensurance"" or ""ensure speedy social housing"", but not ""speedy social housing ensurance"".
2. The phrase ""urychlené zajištění"" in Czech means ""to ensure quickly"" or ""to secure promptly"", so a more accurate translation of the original sentence would be ""speed up social housing ensurance"".
3. The word ""bydlení"" in Czech is not translated into English, but it should be because it's an important part of the phrase. In English, we would use the word ""housing"" instead.

So a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the original sentence in Czech would be:

   Before more than a year, I have been registered on the pages of Tipsport.cz for over a month now.

The translation is accurate and natural-sounding, but it does not fully convey the intended meaning of the original Czech sentence. Here's why:

In Czech, the phrase ""před více než rokem"" means ""more than a year ago"", so the translator correctly captured this aspect of the sentence. However, the rest of the sentence is not entirely accurate.

The original sentence implies that the speaker has been registered on Tipsport.cz for more than a month now, but the translation does not convey this time frame explicitly. To better capture the intended meaning, the translator could have used a phrase like ""for over a month"" or ""since last month"".

This phrase is a play on words in Czech, where the word ""zachraňuji"" has multiple meanings. It can be translated to ""save"", but it also means ""to preserve"" or ""to keep"". The speaker is saying that they do not save the world, but rather they mediate new experiences for others.

The phrase is a clever use of language that highlights the different meanings of the word ""zachraňuji"" and creates a humorous effect. It also emphasizes the idea that the speaker's role is not to save the world, but to provide new experiences for others.",0.6511328388,"

This is an excellent translation because it captures the essence of the original Czech phrase and conveys its meaning in fluent, idiomatic English. Here's why:

2. Grammar: The translator maintained the same grammatical structure in the original phrase, using a verb-subject-object format (""I do not save..."") to convey the meaning of the Czech sentence.
3. Idiomatic expression: The translator used an idiomatic English expression that conveys the same spirit as the original phrase. For example, ""I merely facilitate"" is a more natural way to express the idea of ""zprostředkovávám,"" which can be literally translated as ""I mediate.""

Yes, I can spot what is wrong with the translation. Here are some issues:

1. ""Státní zástupce"" should be translated as ""state prosecutor"" or ""prosecuting attorney,"" not ""state representative.""
2. The phrase ""ve čtvrtek"" (on Thursday) is not necessary and can be omitted in English.
3. The word ""běžné"" (routine) should be translated as ""routine"" or ""normal,"" but it does not fit well in this context, as the investigation into Johnson's death is likely to be a serious matter rather than routine. A better translation might be ""thorough"" or ""detailed.""

   How much do you think about the reader, on a specific human being who will read your text?

In this question, ""čtenář"" can be translated to ""reader,"" but it has a slightly different connotation. A ""čtenář"" is someone who reads, whereas an ""čtenáři"" would refer to multiple readers or the general public. The word choice emphasizes that there is one specific person reading the text rather than many people or the masses.

The following is a list of some common phrases in Czech that may come up during a conversation about food and drinks:

1. Mám povoleno (I have permission) - used to indicate that someone has been given permission to consume a certain amount or type of food/drink.
2. Jedno pivo/jednoho panáka denně (one beer/one schnitzel per day) - used to specify the quantity and type of alcoholic drinks allowed.
3. Snažit se dodržovat (try my best to stick to it) - used to express determination or effort in adhering to a dietary restriction or rule.
4. Co bych rád popil/popila (what I would like to drink) - used to ask for someone's preference of beverage.

In this case, the incompetent translator has made several errors that change the meaning of the original phrase. Here are some of the issues with their translation:

1. ""I have allowed"" should be ""I have permission for"". The word ""allowed"" implies that someone else is granting permission, while ""permission for"" makes it clear that the speaker has given themselves permission.
2. ""one beer or one slice of cake daily"" should be ""one beer or one pastry per day"". Using ""daily"" instead of ""per day"" suggests that the speaker is allowed to consume both a beer and a pastry every day, which isn't what they intended.
3. ""and I am trying to adhere to it"" should simply be left out.

The following sentences show how this translation captures the essence and nuances of the original Czech phrase:

1. Psaní je podivuhodný způsob dialogu - This sentence emphasizes that writing is an unusual or unexpected way of engaging in a conversation, highlighting its unique characteristics compared to spoken dialogue.
2. Writing is a peculiar way of dialogue - The English translation conveys the same idea, using the word ""peculiar"" to convey the sense of something being unusual or distinct from what's typical or expected.
3. Through writing, we can engage in a unique form of dialogue - This sentence expands on the idea by emphasizing that writing allows for a different kind of conversation than spoken dialogue, one that is more introspective and deliberate.
4. Writing as a way of dialoguing with oneself - This sentence takes the idea even further, suggesting that writing can be seen as a form of self-conversation or internal dialogue, which may not have been explicitly conveyed in the original Czech phrase but is certainly implied by its translation into English.

The correct translation (according to Google Translate) would be:

How does the incompetent masterful Czech translator's version compare to the correct one? What kind of error/mistake did they make, and why might that have happened?

I think the error made by the incompetent masterful Czech translator is a matter of word choice. They chose ""strange"" instead of ""peculiar"", which gives a slightly different connotation to the phrase. ""Strange"" can imply something unusual or unexpected, while ""peculiar"" implies something unique or distinctive, but not necessarily unexpected.

Furthermore, it's possible that the incompetent masterful Czech translator may have been influenced by their native language and its word choices, rather than using the most appropriate English words to convey the intended meaning of the original phrase. This is a common mistake made by non-native speakers or those who are not proficient in the target language.

What is wrong with this translation? Can you suggest how to improve it?

Hint: The original Czech phrase has a more nuanced meaning than just ""greed"" or ""fame.""

Answer: There are several issues with the given translation:

1. Incorrect word choice: ""dripping with greed"" is not an idiomatic expression in English, and it doesn't convey the same connotation as the original Czech phrase. A more appropriate phrase might be ""consumed by greed.""
2. Lack of nuance: The translation does not capture the subtle difference between ""bažil"" (to yearn for) and ""byl bažený"" (to be consumed by). In English, it's difficult to convey this distinction with a single word or phrase. However, you could use a more detailed explanation in the translator's note to clarify the meaning:
3. Over-translation: The translation includes unnecessary words and phrases that don't appear in the original Czech sentence. For example, ""yearning for fame"" is not explicitly stated in the Czech phrase",0.6416837924,"I did it mainly because I was after fame and fortune...

The phrase ""dřít"" is not commonly used in modern Czech, but it can be found in older texts or in certain dialects.

The word ""vůle"" means ""willingness"" or ""desire"", and ""ve svém věku"" means ""in your age"".

How long will you have the desire to grind hard and wait for an offer in your age?
  
The translation is perfect, as it captures the essence of the original Czech phrase. However, there are a few minor issues that can be improved upon:
  
1. The word ""dřít"" in the original Czech phrase has multiple meanings, including ""to grind"", ""to gnaw"", and ""to chew"". To make the translation more accurate, it would be better to use the word ""grind"" instead of ""wait for an offer"", as it is a more direct translation.
2. The word ""vůli"" in the original Czech phrase can also be translated as ""will"" or ""desire"". Using the word ""desire"" instead of ""want"" would make the translation more poetic and idiomatic.
3. To make the translation even more natural-sounding, it would be better to use a question mark at the end of the sentence, as the original Czech phrase is a question.

   The general director said that he does not accept evidence from employees who feel uncomfortable and would rather they contact their superiors to report any misconduct.

In this sentence, the word ""důkazy"" is used as a mass noun (a noun that refers to a quantity or amount of something) to refer to evidence of wrongdoing. The phrase ""personálu"" is used to indicate that the evidence comes from employees. The verb ""přijímá"" means ""accepts,"" and in this context, it implies that the general director does not accept evidence from employees who feel uncomfortable reporting misconduct through their normal channels (i.e., contacting their superiors).

The word ""skutky"" is used to refer to the wrongdoing or misconduct that the employees are trying to report. The phrase ""ohlásit skutky"" means ""to report [something]."" In this context, it implies that the general director does not want the employees to report any misconduct directly to him; instead, he wants them to go through their superiors.

Overall, this sentence is saying that the general director is not open to hearing evidence of wrong",0.8252016204,"
   General Director stated that he does not accept evidence from employees who feel uncomfortable and would rather they contact their superiors to report any misconduct.

Generální - General (in this context)
ředitel - Director
řekl - said
že - that
nepřijímá - does not accept
důkazy - evidence
personálu - from employees

The phrase is saying that the General Director stated that he does not accept evidence from employees. The word ""důkazy"" in Czech can be translated to ""evidence"" or ""proof"". The word ""personálu"" specifically refers to employees, so the sentence is stating that the General Director does not accept evidence from employees.

""The law gives parents a certain space to make their decision without rushing,"" said Baratzova.
  
How did the translator do this? Let's break it down!
   
1. Zákon dá - The Czech verb ""dá"" is translated as ""gives."" This is an accurate translation, as the law provides a space or opportunity for parents to make their decision without rushing.
2. rodičům určitý prostor - The phrase ""určitý prostor"" can be broken down into two words: ""určitý,"" which means ""certain,"" and ""prostor,"" which means ""space."" So, the Czech phrase is literally saying that the law gives parents a certain space.
3. aby se svým rozhodnutím nespěchali - The phrase ""aby se svým rozhodnutím nespěchali"" can be broken down into two parts: ""aby,"" which is an archaic way of saying ""in order that""; and ""se svým rozhodnutím nespěchali,"" which means ""to make their decision without rushing.""

1. Zákon (Czech) became ""the law"" in English, as there is no direct Czech equivalent for this word.
2. dá (Czech) became ""gives"" in English to convey the idea of permission or allowance.
3. určitý (Czech) was translated as ""certain"" to convey the idea of a specific and defined amount.
4. prostor (Czech) became ""space"" in English, as it is the closest equivalent for this word in context.

   The elected function does not have a predictable course and our public discussions will shape the oppositional political party and random events, such as the massacre in Newton.

The word ""masakr"" is Czech for ""massacre"", but it is also used to refer to any tragic or devastating event, especially one that involves a large number of victims. In this context, the speaker is using the word to convey the idea that there will be unexpected and dire consequences if the elected function does not have a predictable course.

The sentence is written in a somewhat cryptic and ominous tone, suggesting that the speaker believes that the outcome of the situation will be catastrophic unless something changes.

   Elected office clearly does not have a predictable course and our public discussions will shape an oppositional political party and random events, such as the massacre in Newton.

   Elected function manifestly does not have predictable course and our public discussions will shape oppositional political party and random events like Newton's massacre.

This translation is incorrect in several ways, but most importantly it fails to capture the nuance of the Czech original which is written in a more colloquial tone and style. The word ""volená"" is not simply ""elected"", it carries connotations of something that was chosen or decided upon by popular vote. Additionally, the phrase ""nemá předvídatelný průběh"" does not mean ""manifestly does not have predictable course"", but rather ""does not have a predetermined course"". The word ""preddetermined"" is too strong and implies that there was a preconceived plan or script, which is not what the Czech phrase intends to convey.

Furthermore, the translation of ""naše veřejné rozhovory bude utvářet opoziční politická strana"" as ""our public discussions will shape oppositional political party"" does not accurately capture the meaning of the original Czech phrase. The word ""utvářet"" is more like """,0.8406833496,"

\end{blockquote}

Certainly! The original Czech phrase is quite complex and contains several nuances that can make it challenging to translate accurately. Here are a few reasons why the translation might not feel entirely right:

1. Word order: In English, we tend to put adjectives before nouns, while in Czech, they often follow the noun. This can affect the flow and meaning of the sentence. For example, ""zmatečnou"" (confusing) is an adjective that modifies ""alternativu"" (alternative), but in English, we would typically put it before the noun: ""a confusing alternative.""
2. Prepositions: Czech prepositions often have different meanings or connotations than their English counterparts. For instance, ""zdálo se"" (it seemed) is a more formal and distant",0.7359020733,"

But what about these two phrases? Are they not similar in meaning, or is there a subtle difference between them that only native speakers can detect? Let's take a closer look.
  
The first phrase ""Žalobu za účelem zablokování tohoto zákona"" can be broken down into three parts:
  Žaloba - this word means ""lawsuit"" in Czech, and it refers to the legal action taken by one party against another.
  Za - this preposition is used to indicate the purpose or goal of the lawsuit. In this case, the purpose is to block the bill.
   Účelem - this word means ""for the purpose of"" or ""with the aim of,"" and it further emphasizes that the lawsuit is being filed with the intention of blocking the bill.
  Tohoto zákona - this phrase modifies the noun ""lawsuit"" and specifies which bill is being targeted by the legal action. In this case, we're talking about a specific piece of legislation.",0.8248342909,"
   ""A lawsuit for the purpose of blocking this bill has been filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses.""

But what about the word order? Wouldn't it be more common to say something like ""National Federation of Independent Businesses and 26 states have filed a lawsuit...""? Or is there some reason why the word order in Czech is different from English?
\end{blockquote}

You are correct that in English, it would be more common to use the word order ""National Federation of Independent Businesses and 26 states"" when listing multiple entities as plaintiffs. However, the word order in Czech is not necessarily the same as in English. In Czech, the subject of a sentence typically comes before the verb, which can sometimes result in a different word order than what we are used to in English.

In this case, the phrase "" Žalobu za účelem zablokování tohoto zákona podalo 26 států a Národní federace nezávislých podniků"" is following the typical word order of Czech sentences, where the subject (in this case, ""státy"" or """,0.8154528466,"

The original Czech phrase suggests that even if all the profits from the petrochemical industry in Europe were frozen (i.e., completely eliminated), it would not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being flooded with cheap shale oil from the US.

   And all the frost on the planet would not prevent the cheap oil from the US from flooding the European petrochemical industry with Levonian bitumen.

This is a great example of how the translation process can be challenging, especially when dealing with technical or specialized language. The translator must have a deep understanding of both the source and target languages, as well as the subject matter being translated. In this case, the translator had to understand the nuances of petrochemical industry jargon, as well as the specific reference to ""Levonian bitumen"" which is likely a term unique to the Czech language.

Additionally, the translation must also take into account cultural and regional differences in terminology and usage. For example, the phrase ""zadupání"" (frost) may have different connotations or associations in Czech than it would in English. The translator had to be aware of these potential pitfalls and find a way to convey the intended meaning accurately while still maintaining the cultural context of the original text.

The correct translation of ""těm"" in this context would be ""those"".",0.896621961,"
   Among those who push for relaxation of restrictions on the use of these devices by travelers, there is Amazon.com.

The main issue with this translation is that it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Czech sentence. The word ""těmi"" in the Czech sentence refers to a specific group of people (in this case, those who push for relaxation of restrictions), while the English translation uses the phrase ""there is,"" which implies a more general and vague sense of existence. Additionally, the word order in the two sentences is different, with the Czech sentence placing the emphasis on the action of pushing for relaxation, while the English translation places the emphasis on the fact that Amazon.com exists among those who push for relaxation.

To improve this translation, you could consider using a more accurate and specific word to convey the meaning of ""těmi"" in the Czech sentence. For example, you could use the phrase ""those who advocate for relaxation"" or ""proponents of relaxation"" to better capture the intended meaning.

The provided Czech phrase ""Mezi těmi, kdo tlačí na to, aby se uvolnila omezení pro používání těchto zařízení cestujícími, je Amazon.com"" is a bit tricky, but I'll do my best to provide a correct translation and explain the meaning in detail.

First of all, let me point out that the phrase ""Mezi těmi, kdo tlačí na to"" can be translated as ""among those who press on (to something)"" or ""between those who push for (something)"". So, the sentence is saying that there are some entities (or people) who are pushing for relaxing restrictions on the use of certain devices by travelers.

Now, let's take a closer look at the phrase ""Aby se uvolnila o",0.673184501,Among those pushing for relaxation of the rules are Amazon.com...,0.9104350684
403,"""Zkušenosti byly tehdy minimální,"" odhaduje Kasal, jak se budou letošní rozhovory vyvíjet.","""We had minimal experience at the time,"" reckons Kasal, as to how this year’s talks will develop.","
   ""Experiences were then minimal,"" estimates Kasal, how this year's conversations will develop..."")
\end{code}

In the original sentence in Czech, there is a phrase ""tehdy minimální"" which can be translated as ""then minimal"". The word ""minimální"" has two meanings:

1. Minimal - describing something that is of little importance or size.
2. Minimum - describing the smallest amount or degree of something.

In this sentence, the meaning of ""minimální"" is closer to ""minimum"", as it refers to the small number of experiences that were had at that time.

So, the correct translation of ""tehdy minimální"" would be ""then minimum"".",0.7436061084,"
  
  Experiences were then minimal.
  
  Can you identify what grammatical structure is being used in this translation?
  And can you explain why it was chosen over other possible structures?",0.5456477759,"
   Minimal experiences were then. According to Kasal, this year's conversations will develop further.

How does the translation differ from the original? What might be some potential issues with the translation?

The main difference between the original Czech phrase and its English translation is that the word order has been changed. In Czech, the phrase begins with ""Zkušenosti byly tehdy minimální,"" which places the emphasis on the fact that experiences were minimal at that time. In contrast, the English translation starts with ""Minimal experiences were then,"" which changes the focus to the concept of minimalism itself rather than the temporal aspect of the experience.

Another potential issue with the translation is that the word ""odhaduje"" (which means ""estimates"" or ""predicts"") may not have an exact equivalent in English. The translator has chosen to render it as ""According to Kasal,"" which conveys a similar sense of estimation, but loses some of the precision and specificity of the original word.

Finally, the phrase ""letošní rozhovory"" (this year's conversations) may not be immediately familiar to English speakers, so the translation could benefit",0.5774324241,"
   Experiences were then minimal.

The competent but literal-minded translator translates it as follows:

\end{blockquote}

The phrase ""bez toho, že by se vystavil nebezpečí"" (without putting him in danger) is a bit more nuanced than just "" bez nebezpečí"" (without danger). The word ""nebezpečí"" can be translated as ""danger"", but it also carries the connotation of risk, threat, or exposure to harm.

In the original Czech phrase, the use of ""nebezpečí"" emphasizes that Mr. Snowden could potentially face danger or harm if he were to testify in person. This subtle nuance is lost in translation when the phrase is rendered as simply ""without danger"".

   The festive markets on Upper Square will begin a month before Christmas.

The sentence is grammatically correct and it means that the festive markets will start one month before Christmas, specifically on Upper Square (Horním náměstí). However, there are a few minor issues with the translation:

1. The word ""bohatý"" in Czech should be translated as ""rich"" or ""lavish"", not ""bohatý"" which means ""expensive"". So, the correct translation of the phrase ""bohatý kulturní program"" would be ""rich cultural program"".
2. In English, it's more common to say ""a month before Christmas"" instead of ""one month before Christmas"".
3. The word ""zahájeny"" in Czech is not commonly used in this context and can be replaced with a more natural phrase like ""spustí se"" or ""bude spuštěno"".

So, the corrected translation would be:

The festive markets on Upper Square will begin a month before Christmas, featuring a rich cultural program.",0.7629734584,"

   Campaign Business for Britain was launched in April with the promise to connect companies and define how British businesses and organizations creating jobs want to see changes in their relationship with the EU.

The translation is perfect, but there are a few minor issues that can be improved upon:

1. The word ""spuštěna"" in Czech is often translated as ""launched,"" but it could also be translated as ""initiated"" or ""started."" Using ""initiated"" instead of ""launched"" might make the translation more precise.
2. The phrase ""vztahu s EU"" can be translated as ""their relationship with the EU,"" but using ""relationship with the European Union"" would provide more context and clarity for non-native speakers who may not be familiar with the abbreviation ""EU.""

Here's why this translation is wrong:

The original Czech phrase contains two infinitive phrases in a row, each beginning with the word ""zastavování"" (stopping) and ""prohledání"" (searching). In English, it would be more idiomatic to render these as a single infinitive phrase, using ""stop and search"" or ""stopping and searching"":

""The tactics of stopping and searching individuals were criticized by lines of defenders of civil rights.""

Here's why this translation is more accurate than the given one:

1. Word order: In Czech, the phrase starts with ""Taktika zastavování,"" which means ""tactics of stopping,"" while in English, it would be more natural to start with ""The tactics of stopping.""
2. Prepositions: The preposition ""a"" in Czech is often translated as ""and"" in English, but in this case, since we're dealing with two separate actions (stopping and searching), it's better to use the preposition ""of"" to indicate that these are different aspects of",0.6167302003,"

   When these children were born, you didn't call a psychologist but an surgeon.
  Spanish:
    ¡Cuando nacieron esos niños, no llamaste a un psicólogo sino a un cirujano!

This idiom is used to describe a situation where someone has been dealt a difficult hand in life, and the challenges they face are so great that it seems like they need surgery (a drastic solution) rather than psychological help. The phrase is often used humorously or ironically to emphasize the severity of the person's problems.

In Czech, the idiom uses a wordplay between ""chirurg"" (surgeon) and ""chytrý"" (smart), which creates a humorous effect. In Spanish, the phrase is more direct and literal, using the word ""cirujano"" (surgeon) to convey the idea of a drastic solution being needed.

Overall, this idiom is used to express empathy for someone who is facing significant challenges in life, and to acknowledge that their situation is difficult and may require extraordinary measures to overcome.",0.6339924842,"
   When these children were born, you didn't call a psychologist but a surgeon.
                      --------------------
    The literal translation of this idiomatic expression is:
     When these children were born, you did not summon a psychiatrist but an operating physician. 

This phrase is often used to describe situations where someone has a problem or issue that requires immediate and drastic action rather than talking about it or trying to find a solution through psychotherapy. The idea behind the expression is that sometimes, especially when dealing with children, you need to take direct action to solve the problem instead of just talking about it.

The word ""chirurg"" in Czech is an archaic term for a surgeon, and is no longer commonly used in modern medical practice. However, the phrase has been preserved in colloquial language and is still widely understood.",0.829561095,"
   When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist but an surgeon.

The original meaning of this idiomatic expression is that when someone has a problem or issue with their own child (or sometimes even with other people), they don't seek help from a specialist in mental health (psychiatry) but instead try to solve the problem on their own, often by using forceful and drastic measures.

The idiom is based on the idea that when children are born, they come into the world with no pre-existing conditions or problems, so any issues they may have later in life must be caused by something external (e.g., poor upbringing, trauma, etc.). Therefore, if someone has a problem with their own child, it is as if they had called for an surgeon to operate on the child rather than seeking help from a psychiatrist.

The idiom can be used in various contexts where someone tries to solve a problem or issue without considering other options or seeking professional help. It is often used sarcastically or ironically to suggest that the person trying to solve the problem is not using the most appropriate approach and may even make things worse.",0.8102772238,"

203,A to nemusí mít dlouhého trvání.,And it might not take that long.,"
   The meeting does not have to be long.

The word ""nemusí"" is a negation of the verb ""muset"", which means ""must"". So, the sentence ""A to nemusí mít dlouhého trvání"" can be translated as ""And it doesn't have to be long-lasting."" or simply ""It doesn't have to be long.""

In this case, the word ""nemusí"" is used to indicate that something is not obligatory or necessary. The sentence is saying that the meeting does not have to be long, it can be short and still be effective.",0.5515917261,"
   ""It doesn't have to be a long-lasting thing.""

The given Czech sentence is grammatically correct, but it could benefit from some adjustments in terms of word choice and phrasing to make it more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English. Here are the suggested improvements:

1. ""A"" can be omitted because it's implied by the context.
2. Instead of ""nemusí,"" which is a bit formal, we could use ""doesn't have to.""
3. To make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding, we can replace ""it doesn't have to be"" with simply ""it doesn't.""
4. Finally, instead of ""a long-lasting thing,"" which is a bit wordy, we could use the phrase ""long-term.""

\end{code}

Certainly, I'd be happy to help! The word order in the translation is a bit uncommon in English, but it follows a common pattern in Czech. Here's a breakdown of why the words are ordered as they are:

1. ""Since then"" - This phrase is used to indicate a point of time in the past and marks the beginning of the action described by the sentence. In Czech, this would be translated as ""Od té doby,"" which literally means ""from that time on.""
2. ""this number has not been updated"" - The main message of the sentence is conveyed through the negative statement about the number being unchanged. This part of the sentence is structured in a more straightforward way, with the subject (""this number"") followed by the verb phrase (""has not been updated"").
3. The word order",0.3512339741,"
   ""From that time on, this number has not been updated.""

The translation is correct and captures the meaning of the original text. However, it may lack some nuances or subtleties present in the original language. Here are a few possible improvements to make the translation more idiomatic:

1. Use ""ever since"" instead of ""from that time on"": This phrase is more commonly used in English and better conveys the idea of a continuous period of time. So, the translation could be: ""Ever since then, this number has not been updated.""
2. Add a bit more context to make it clearer who or what is responsible for the non-update: For example, ""The company has not updated this number ever since the project was completed"" or ""This number has remained unchanged since the last time we reviewed it.""
3. Consider using an alternative phrase that better captures the idea of a lack of updates: Instead of saying ""has not been updated,"" you could say ""remains unchanged"" or ""has not been revised."" For example, ""The company has not revised this number since the project was completed"" or ""This number remains unchanged ever since we last reviewed",0.4301980776,"
   ""Since then, this number has not been updated."".

The correct translation of the phrase should be:

""From that time on, this number has not been updated."" or ""As of that time, this number has not been updated.""

So, what happened here? Why did the translator choose ""Hizballáh"" instead of ""Hezbollah""? There are several possible reasons:

1. Lack of familiarity with the correct term: The translator may not have been aware of the proper English spelling and pronunciation of ""Hezbollah"". This is especially likely if they are not native English speakers or if they specialize in other languages.
2. Confusion with similar-sounding terms: ""Hizballáh"" and ""Hezbollah"" sound quite similar, and it's possible that the translator confused the two phrases. This is especially likely if they are not familiar with the correct spelling and pronunciation of both",0.5512473562,"

  However, upon reviewing the translation, you notice that there is one small error. The word ""procent"" should be translated as ""percentage"", not ""ratio"". You correct this and the final corrected English translation of the Czech phrase becomes:
   ""Malians are at the top of the ladder with an HDP percentage of 80%, which is a growth from 60% in 2008.""

Question: What is the difference between ""procent"" and ""percentage""? Can you provide examples where one might be more appropriate than the other?

Answer: In Czech, ""procent"" can be translated to English as either ""percentage"" or ""ratio"". However, there are certain situations where one term may be more appropriate than the other.

A percentage is a fraction of 100, and it represents a proportion of something relative to a larger whole. For example: ""The company's profit increased by 25% last year."" In this case,",0.8305536005,"

What is wrong with the translation?

Hint: There is more than one error.

Answer:

1. ""zlato"" should be translated as ""gold"", not ""made of gold"".
2. ""položek"" should be translated as ""items"" or ""products"", not ""stopped"".
3. The phrase ""ve 200 městských zastavárnách"" should be translated as ""in 200 urban bus stops"", not just ""are stopped in"".

The goal here was not just a word-for-word translation but rather an attempt at conveying the intended meaning and atmosphere in both languages. This type of translation is known as ""free translation"" or ""adaptation."" It can be useful when you need to convey complex ideas, emotions, or cultural references that are difficult to translate literally.

However, there may still be some nuances lost in translation. For example, the word ""prosklených"" (glazed) has a specific connotation of transparency and openness, which might not be fully conveyed by the English phrase ""completely glazed."" Additionally, the Czech phrase emphasizes the interconnectedness between the interior and exterior spaces, which could be harder to capture in a single English sentence.

In these cases, it may be helpful to provide additional context or clarify any specific cultural references that need to be understood. Alternatively, you can use multiple sentences or phrases to convey the intended meaning more accurately.

In this case, both translations are grammatically correct, but they convey different meanings.

How does this translation work? Let's break it down:

1. Pro is a preposition that means ""for"" or ""on behalf of"". In this phrase, it indicates that something is being done in favor of someone or something else.
2. Prospala is the second word in the phrase, and it is a feminine noun that means ""family"". So the phrase as a whole can be translated to English as ""for her family"".
3. byla vždycky na prvním místě means ""has always been on top of everything"" in this case, the subject (rodina) is emphasized using the adverbial phrase ""na prvním místě"", which indicates that the family has always been a priority for the speaker.
4. naplno podřížit se means ""to fully devote oneself to something"". In this context, it implies that the speaker wants to dedicate herself completely to her family at the age of 38. The verb ""podřížit"" is in the infinitive form here",0.8023877305,"

This example illustrates a key aspect of translation, which is that it is not enough to simply replace words from one language with equivalent words in another.

In this example, the Czech phrase ""ve svém společném prohlášení"" is translated as ""in their own words,"" which conveys the idea that the banks will be speaking for themselves, rather than using a pre-prepared statement or relying on someone else to speak on their behalf.

My evaluation of the provided translation is that it is mostly accurate but somewhat stilted and lacking in fluency, naturalness, and idiomaticity. Here's why:

1. Accuracy: The translator has successfully captured the meaning of the original Czech phrase, with only a minor deviation (see below).
2. Fluency: The English translation is somewhat wordy and lacks the conciseness and flow of the original Czech phrase. For example, ""in their own words"" could be shortened to simply ""their statement.""
3. Idiomaticity: The translator has not fully captured the idiomatic expression of the original Czech phrase, which is more colloquial and conversational.

The translation is correct and well-written, but there are some minor issues that could be improved:

1. The phrase ""nedaleko Montmartru"" (near Montmartre) would be better translated as ""close to Montmartre"" or ""in the vicinity of Montmartre"" to convey a more precise location.
2. The word ""turisty"" is not necessary in the translation, as it can be inferred from the context that the destination is popular among tourists. A simpler phrase would be ""a popular destination for visitors.""
3. The sentence structure could be improved by reversing the order of the clauses to make the meaning clearer: ""You would find it in the trendy 18th district, close to Montmartre, a popular destination for visitors.""
4. Finally, the phrase ""módní 18. obvod"" (trendy 18th district) could be translated as simply ""the 18th arrondissement",0.7192596029,"
   For whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' Naked Lunch, you would find it in a trendy district of Prague 18, near Montmartre and popular with tourists.

However, I do not think that this is an accurate translation for the following reasons:

1) The original phrase does not mention ""Prague"" or any other specific city, so it seems misleading to include a location in the English translation.
2) ""Nahý oběd"" is a Czech idiomatic expression meaning ""naked lunch"", but this nuance is lost in the English translation which only mentions William Burroughs' book title.
3) The phrase ""nedaleko Montmartru"" can be translated as ""near Montmartre"" or even more accurately as ""in the vicinity of Montmartre"", but the word order and phrasing of the English translation does not convey this sense of proximity to Montmartre.
4) Finally, the phrase is written in a somewhat formal tone, while the original Czech phrase has an informal tone. The English translation could be more idiomatic by using a less formal register.

In this case, the phrase ""Plzeň stále umí vyhrávat"" could be translated as either ""Plzen still knows how to win"" or ""Plzen is skilled at winning"".

The word ""slibuje"" in the second part of the sentence is also worth noting. It can be translated as ""promises"", but it has a more formal and obligatory connotation than the English word ""promise"". In this context, Rajtoral's statement could be interpreted as a promise or guarantee that Plzen will continue to win.

The context is that this is for a travel company website in the UK targeting Czechs who are planning to visit the UK. The purpose of the text is to inform these potential tourists about what they need to do before embarking on their journey, and one important piece of information is that they must turn off or put their devices into airplane mode during flight takeoff and landing.
  Can AI translate this as well? Sure! Here's the attempt:
   According to some studies, up to a third of travelers overlook or disregard the requirement to switch off their gadgets..

While it is technically correct, there are several issues with this translation. Firstly, ""overlook"" and ""disregard"" do not convey the same level of importance as ""forget"". Secondly, the phrase ""switch off"" may not be immediately clear to non-",0.5278528753,"
   Some studies suggest that up to a third of travelers forget or ignore the requirement to turn off their devices.

   Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.

The first thing to notice is that the word order in Czech phrases tends to be more flexible than in English. The subject-verb-object word order is often reversed or adjusted for emphasis or clarity, especially when using relative clauses or subordinate clauses. In this case, ""Cestující"" (passengers) is the subject of the sentence, but it comes after the verb ""mohou"" (can), which is in turn followed by the object ""dělat"" (do something). This word order adjustment emphasizes that passengers are capable of doing something during most of the flight.

Another characteristic of Czech phrases is the use of infinitive phrases instead of finite verbs. In this sentence, ""během převážné části letu"" (during most of the flight) is an infinitive phrase functioning as a prepositional phrase modifying the verb ""mohou."" This construction allows for more flexibility in expressing temporal relationships and emphasizes that the action of doing something takes",0.8584386656,"

Answer: Here's the proper translation of the given Czech phrase into English, along with some explanatory notes on cultural and linguistic considerations:

Word-for-word translation: The survey of the Erste Savings Barometer group shows that people are swimming out from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

Explanation:

1. ""Vyplývá"" is a verb that can be translated as ""swim out"" or ""emerge,"" but it's not a common phrase in English. A more idiomatic expression would be ""people are emerging from.""
2. ""Průzkumu skupiny Erste Savings Barometr"" is the name of the survey conducted by the Erste Group, which is a financial services provider operating in Central and Eastern Europe",0.4507741888,According to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer in central and eastern European countries...,0.969187936

Hint: The word ""zastavují"" in the original Czech phrase might be translated as ""stop using"" or ""cease to use"" rather than simply ""halt"". Additionally, the phrase ""nezvyšuje dluh domácnosti"" might be better rendered as ""does not increase household debt burden"" or similar.",0.782348766,"""Customers are stopping to buy things they already own and the increase in personal debt is not helping household finances,"" he says.

The correct answer is (B) During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.",0.8818092557,"
   During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.

The translation is correct but it's not very idiomatic or natural in English. Here are a few suggestions for more natural ways to express the same idea:

1. Doctors offer medical care during each of these weekends. (This phrase emphasizes that the doctors are providing ongoing care, rather than just one-time assistance.)
2. Doctors provide medical services every weekend. (This phrase is shorter and more concise, but it still conveys the idea that the doctors are offering continuous care.)
3. The doctors offer their expertise over each of these weekends. (This phrase emphasizes the doctors' professionalism and specialized knowledge.)
4. Doctors lend a hand during every one of these weekends. (This phrase is more casual and conversational, but it still conveys the idea that the doctors are providing assistance.)",0.6602313896,"
   During every one of these weekends, doctors provide various medical help.

Please indicate what is wrong with this translation and how it should be corrected.

2085,"Byl upřímný doma jen ve dnech, kdy babičkovala a měla kolem sebe vnoučata Elinku nebo Adíka.",It was sincere only at home in the days when she was being grandma and had her grandchildren Elinka or Adik around.,"
  1. She was truly at home only on the days when she baby-sat her grandchildren Elinka or Adik and had them around her.

In this sentence, ""byl upřímný doma"" is a set phrase that can be translated as ""was truly at home"". The word order in Czech is different from English, so the verb ""baby-sat"" is moved to the end of the sentence for better clarity. Additionally, the names Elinka and Adik are provided in parentheses to give more context to the reader who may not be familiar with these names.",0.7367658957,"

   She was genuinely at home only on days when she baby-sat her grandchildren, Elinka or Adika.

How did the translator manage to produce such a good translation? In this case, the translator used their knowledge of Czech and English to perform the following tasks:
 1. Identify the meaning of each word in the source phrase. 
   The first word ""Byl"" is the past tense form of ""be"", which indicates that the subject was in a certain state or condition at some point in the past. The verb ""upřímný"" means ""genuine"" or ""sincere"". The adverb ""doma"" means ""at home"".
   The phrase ""jen ve dnech"" is an idiomatic expression that indicates a specific time period, similar to English phrases such as ""only on weekdays"" or ""just during the summer."" Here it specifies that the subject was genuinely at home only on certain days. 
   Next we have ""kdy babičkovala"", which is another idiomatic expression indicating a specific activity, in this case, baby-sitting (babičku"" means grandmother",0.721993607,"

The phrase ""to ale asi"" is often used in informal speech to indicate that something may not be the best example or may not be worth imitating. The word ""ale"" means ""but"" or ""however,"" and ""asi"" means ""more or less."" So, the phrase as a whole can be translated to English as ""but sort of"" or ""kind of.""

   ""The high-standing merchant said that despite significant daily trading volume with foreign currencies, the fragmentation of liquidity among different commercial platforms and banks through their own internal systems means you can start having an impact on the market at relatively low prices.""

Here's how the masterful translator did it:

1. Vysoce postavený obchodník (high-standing merchant) was translated as ""masterful"" to convey the idea of someone who is highly skilled and knowledgeable in their field.
2. The phrase Rozkouskování likvidity (fragmentation of liquidity) was translated literally, but with a slight modification to make it more idiomatic in ",0.9101847762,"

In this example, the original Czech phrase is quite long and contains several clauses. The translation maintains the same structure, with each clause translated separately to create a cohesive sentence in English. 

The use of ""which"" at the beginning of the second part of the sentence is particularly noteworthy.

   ""The editorial management of the newspaper New Express was unorganized,"" said the administrator in his statement.",0.7867018195,"
   ""The editorial management of the newspaper New Express was disorganized,"" said the administrator in his statement.

Can you spot what the translator did to make the translation so smooth and natural-sounding? Here's a hint: it has something to do with word order!

In Czech, the phrase is structured as Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), with ""Redakční vedení"" being the subject and ""bylo neuspořádané"" being the object. In English, however, we would typically use a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order, so the translator wisely rearranged the words to make the sentence sound more natural in ",0.6236751406,"
  
""The editorial leadership of the newspaper New Express was disorganized,"" said the manager in his statement.
   
How did the masterful Czech translator do this? Let's take a closer look at the translation process and explore how the efficient translator was able to achieve such high-quality results with ease.
  
1. Understanding the Source Language: The first step in any successful translation is understanding the source language. In this case, the Czech phrase ""Redakční vedení novin New Express bylo neuspořádané"" must be analyzed to ensure that every word and grammatical structure is fully comprehended.
2. Identifying Key Phrases: The next step is identifying key phrases within the source language. In this case, ""Redakční vedení novin New Express"" can be broken down into several key phrases: ""redakční,"" ""vedení,"" ""novin,"" and ""New Express.""
3. Translating Key Phrases: With a solid understanding of the source language and key phrases identified, the translator can begin to translate each phrase into English. For example, ""Redakční vedení"" might be translated",0.5329534117,"
   ""The editorial leadership of the newspaper New Express was disorganized,"" said the manager.

Here's what is wrong with this translation:
  1. ""Redakční vedení"" should be translated as ""editorial management"", not ""editorial leadership"". 
  2. The word ""neuspořádané"" cannot be simply translated into English as ""disorganized"". It has a more specific meaning of being chaotic, unstructured or lacking order. A better translation would be ""haphazard"" or ""random"", but even that doesn't quite capture the full nuance of the word. 
  3. The phrase should be translated as an independent clause rather than a sentence fragment.

Here is the corrected English version:

  However, upon closer inspection, there is a slight nuance that has been lost in translation.

These two words are plural nouns, indicating that the Ministry will be issuing multiple curricula for various subjects, not just English and mathematics.

Answer: The correct translation of ""Ministerstvo školství by mělo zítra vydat nové osnovy pro angličtinu a matematiku"" would be something like:

   There are disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the CSSD.

The word ""vybublají"" is a bit tricky, as it can be translated to several different words depending on the context. Here's some possible translations:

* ""arguments are brewing"" (a slightly more informal translation)

Which one is more accurate? Why?

Please note that I'm not asking for a word-for-word translation, but rather an idiomatic English version that conveys the same meaning and nuance as the original Czech phrase.
\end{question}

The second option ""There are squabbles within the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the CSSD"" is more accurate, here's why:

1. Grammar: The original Czech phrase uses the verb ""vybublají,"" which is in the present tense and indicates an ongoing situation. In English, we would use a similar construction to convey this sense of continuity, so ""There are squabbles"" rather than ""There was/were squabbles.""
2. Idiomatic expression: The phrase ""vybublají spory"" is idiomatic in Czech and means that there are ongoing disputes or conflicts within the organization. In English, a more common way to express this would be ""there are squ",0.4575118536,"""There are growing disputes within the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the CSSD.""

  A feeling of being lost when all hope disappears and one's mental state deteriorates to such an extent that it is as if they have died psychologically, resulting in a new quality emerging.
  
  Here are some key points about the translation:
    - The word ""ryzí"" was translated as ""a feeling of being lost"", which accurately conveys the idea of disorientation and confusion that comes with losing all hope.
    - The phrase ""zmizí všechna naděje"" was translated as ""all hope disappears"". This captures the idea that when one's hopes are extinguished, it can be difficult to find a sense of purpose or direction in life.
    - The term ""psychicky 'umře'"" was translated as ""one's mental state deteriorates"" which emphasizes the negative impact on one's psychological well-being when all hope is lost.
    - Finally, the phrase ""nastupuje nová kvalita"" was translated as ""a new quality emerges"". This suggests that even in the midst of despair and hopelessness, there may be an opportunity for growth or",0.8411122555,"
  
     A sense of pure despair - that one is lost when all hope disappears, and one's psyche ""dies"" as a result.

I have three questions about this translation:

1) Is it common for native Czech speakers to use the word ""pocit"" (feeling/sensation) in phrases that describe abstract concepts like hope or despair? I've found several online resources suggesting that ""pocit"" is more commonly used when describing physical sensations, rather than emotional states.
2) The phrase ""umře"" (dies) seems to be an unusual choice for a metaphorical death of one's psyche. Is this word commonly used in Czech to describe the loss of hope or other abstract concepts? If not, why did the translator choose it specifically here?
3) The phrase ""nová kvalita"" (new quality) is translated as ""a new quality"". However, I would have expected something more like ""a new perspective"" or ""a fresh outlook"", to better convey the idea of a change in one's emotional state. Was this choice intentional, and if so, why?

I",0.6959146787,"
   ""A real feeling - that man is lost when all hope disappears, he dies psychically and a new quality arises.""

What's wrong with this translation?

(Note: I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous question. The original Czech phrase was incorrect, but the incompetent masterful translator made it even more incorrect.)

Answer: There are several issues with the English translation provided:

1. ""Ryzí pocit"" should be translated as ""primal feeling"" or ""raw emotion"", not ""real feeling"".
2. ""Ztracen"" in Czech means ""lost"", but it is often used to describe a situation where someone has lost their way, not necessarily that they have disappeared completely. A more appropriate translation of ""ztracen"" in this context would be ""disoriented"" or ""lost one's bearings"".
3. ""Pokud zmizí všechna naděje"" should be translated as ""if all hope disappears"", not ""when all hope disappears"". The use of the conditional tense is more appropriate here, as it implies a hypothetical situation rather than a certain outcome.

I'm very happy to see such a high-quality translation! However, as an NLP enthusiast, I would like to point out that there is room for improvement in terms of fluency and readability. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use more natural phrasing: The original Czech phrase has a slightly informal tone, while the translation sounds a bit stilted. To make it sound more natural, you could use a more conversational tone and wording. For example: ""I've attached some screenshots that prove the issue with registration was already present before October 31st, so this 'false' registration shouldn't be an issue.""
2. Simplify complex sentences: The translation has several long and complex sentences, which can make it difficult to follow for non-native speakers. To improve readability, you could break up the longer sentences into shorter ones or use simpler sentence structures. For example: ""I have submitted screenshots that show the registration issue was present before October 31st. This 'false",0.6044909133,"
   I have submitted several screenshots that this problem with registration was already before October 31st, so ""false"" registration on this is simply not relevant.

The correct translation of the original Czech sentence should be:

Can you explain why my suggested translation is more accurate than the original one?

I believe that the main issue with the original translation is that it uses the phrase ""Catholic farities"" which doesn't accurately convey the meaning of the Czech word ""farnosti"", which refers to a territorial unit of administration within a diocese, and not to individual Catholic churches or parishes. Additionally, using the word ""approach"" in the original translation may also give a slightly different connotation than what is intended by the original phrase, as it could suggest a more casual or informal attitude towards these issues, whereas the Czech phrase emphasizes the importance of addressing them carefully and thoughtfully.

In contrast, my suggested translation uses the word ""address"" instead of ""approach"", which better conveys the idea that the Vatican is interested in",0.8867864748,"The Vatican wants to know how Catholic parishes around the world approach sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.",0.9730505675
2694,"Při výkonu tohoto povolání je třeba nejen vysoká odborná profesionalita, ale také lidský přístup a osobní přesvědčení.","In performing this profession, you need not only a high level of professionalism, but also a human touch and personal conviction.","
  1. During the performance of this profession, not only high professionalism is required but also human approach and personal conviction.

The phrase ""lidský přístup"" can be translated to ""human approach"", which emphasizes the importance of treating others with kindness, understanding, and empathy in a professional setting. The word ""odborná profesionalita"" is often translated as ""high professionalism"" or ""specialized expertise"".

In this context, the sentence suggests that to be successful in this profession, one needs not only technical knowledge but also interpersonal skills and personal qualities such as empathy and a human touch.",0.903636261,"

     je třeba nejen vysoká odborná profesionalita = is required (not only) high professionalism
      ale také lidský přístup = and also human approach
       a osobní přesvědčení = and personal conviction

Note that the English phrase ""human approach"" captures the meaning of the Czech word ""lidský přístup"", which emphasizes the importance of interpersonal skills and empathy in this profession. The phrase ""personal conviction"" accurately translates the Czech word ""osobní přesvědčení"", which implies a strong belief or commitment to one's work.",0.7248200835,"

What's wrong with the translation? What does the original Czech phrase really mean? How would you translate it correctly into English?

Hint: The word ""při"" in the original phrase has a specific meaning that is often missed by non-native speakers.

Answer:

The original Czech phrase ""Při výkonu tohoto povolání"" can be literally translated as ""During the performance of this profession"", but it has a more subtle meaning than just ""during"". The word ""při"" in this context implies that something is being performed or done in conjunction with, or as part of, another action. In other words, it emphasizes the idea that professionalism and human approach are not separate entities, but rather they go hand in hand.

The correct translation into English would be: ""In exercising this profession, it is essential not only to have high professionalism but also a humane approach and personal conviction."" The word ""in"" is used instead of ""during"" to convey the idea that these qualities are inherently linked.",0.6497111916,"""This profession not only requires high professionalism but also human approach and personal conviction.""",0.9600928507

The sentence is grammatically correct in both languages, but it's not a direct translation. It's a more idiomatic expression in English that conveys the same meaning as the original Czech phrase. The word ""občanům"" (citizens) is not directly translated to English because it's not a common way to address citizens in English, and using such an expression would sound awkward or formal. Instead, the translator chose to use the more natural-sounding ""to the citizens.""

This example illustrates how translation can involve more than just replacing words with their direct equivalents in another language.

The correct answer is that the provided Czech sentence does not need any adjustments in terms of accuracy; it is already a grammatically correct English phrase: ""I apologized to the members of the council and now also to the citizens.""

Explanation:

In this case, the original Czech sentence is written in a simple past tense (omluvil jsem), which corresponds to the English past simple tense (apologized). The verb ""omluvit"" has several meanings, including apologize and excuse oneself. In this context, the most appropriate translation would be ""I apologized.""

The phrase ""a teď i občanům"" can be translated as ""and now also to the citizens,"" which is a common way of extending an apology to a wider audience or group of people.

They believe that this vaccine could be an effective tool in helping people overcome addiction to cigarettes.

There are a few issues with your attempt to translate the phrase back into Czech:

1. The word ""úžas"" (wonder, amazement) is not the best choice to convey the meaning of ""pleasure"". A more appropriate word would be ""odezva"" (sensation, feeling).
2. The sentence structure is a bit off. In Czech, it's more common to put adjectives after the noun they modify, rather than before it as in English. So instead of ""Nová vakcína proti nikotinu může odejmout úžas z kouření"", it should be ""Nová vakcína proti nikotinu může ode",0.5652574269,"

When you translate a sentence from one language to another, especially when using machine translation tools like Google Translate, the output may not always be an exact word-for-word translation. This is because different languages have different grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions, which can lead to changes in word order, verb tenses, and even the choice of words used.

   In case of conviction, they face imprisonment from 10 years to life.

The question is whether this translation accurately conveys the meaning and nuances of the original Czech phrase? And if not, what changes could be made to improve it?
\end{blockquote}

While the translator's English version is grammatically correct, there are some subtle differences in nuance between the two languages that may affect how the sentence is perceived by native speakers of each language. Here are a few potential improvements:

1. ""Odsouzení"" vs. ""conviction"": In Czech, ""odsouzení"" specifically refers to the legal verdict and sentencing, while in English, ""conviction"" has more connotations of guilt or innocence. To maintain the nuance, the translator could use ""sentencing"" instead of ""conviction.""
2. ""Trestům odnětí svobody"" vs. ""imprisonment"": The Czech phrase emphasizes the specific punishment of imprisonment more explicitly than the English translation does. To capture this, the translator might choose to render it as ""serving a prison sentence"" or",0.567897939,"
   ""In case of sentencing, he/she will face penalties ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.""

Is this translation accurate? If not, what would be a more appropriate translation for the given Czech phrase?
\end{blockquote}

No, the provided English translation is not entirely accurate. Here's a more appropriate translation of the given Czech phrase:

""In case of sentencing, he/she will face imprisonment ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.""

Here's why:

* ""Odsouzení"" (the subject of the sentence) is translated as ""sentencing"", not ""penalties"". Penalties are a broader term that includes fines, community service, etc., but in this context, we're talking about imprisonment.
* The phrase ""odnětí svobody"" means ""to be deprived of freedom"", which is more accurately translated as ""imprisonment"" or ""incarceration"". ""From 10 years to life imprisonment"" is a more accurate translation of the range of possible sentences.

Thank you!

Answer: The changes in word order and vocabulary are due to differences between Czech and English sentence structure. Here's a breakdown of each change:

1. Word order: In Czech, the verb often comes at the end of the sentence, while in English it typically comes before the subject. To maintain the original meaning, the translator had to reverse the word order in the English sentence.
2. ""Nikdo"" vs. ""no one"": Both words are used to convey the idea that nobody doubts someone's abilities, but they have slightly different connotations. ""Nikdo"" is more formal and emphasizes the absence of doubt, while ""no one"" is less formal and can also imply a sense of",0.6237903976,"

Sure! Here's an improved version of the translation:

""Unfortunately, I have to announce with regret that I do have a contract, but it just isn't what I had hoped for.""

Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:

* ""Bohužel"" is a more idiomatic way to express ""unfortunately"" in English. It conveys a sense of disappointment and regret.
* ""Sám bych rád oznámil"" can be translated as ""I would have announced with regret."" This phrase emphasizes the idea that the speaker had hoped to announce something, but now must express regret instead.
* ""Nějakou smlouvu mám"" is a more literal translation of ""some contract,"" but it's not very idiomatic in English. Instead, I suggest using ""a contract"" or simply ""I have a contract."" This makes the sentence flow better",0.714227884,"Unfortunately, I have a contract, but it's just not that simple...",0.8601419793

  ",0.8785644574,"
   ""It has been revealed that Americans were also monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.""

However, if we look at this phrase more closely, we can see some potential issues with the translation. Specifically:

1. The word order is different in Czech and English. In Czech, the sentence starts with ""Mimo jiné"" (meaning ""apart from that""), while in English, it would be more common to start with ""It has been revealed that."" This may not affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it can make a difference in terms of tone and emphasis.
2. The phrase ""sledovali i"" (meaning ""were also monitoring"") is somewhat awkward to translate directly into English. A more natural way to express this idea might be ""have been monitored as well."" This again may not affect the overall meaning, but it can make a difference in terms of clarity and flow.
3. The phrase ""německé kancléřky"" (meaning ""German Chancellor"") is somewhat longer than the equivalent English phrase ""Chancellor Angela Merkel."" This may not be a significant issue, but it can affect the",0.7270828657,"
   In addition, it has been revealed that Americans were also monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.

The question is: What would be a more idiomatic or natural way to translate this sentence in English?

Note: I am looking for a translation that better captures the nuances of the original Czech phrase, rather than a literal word-for-word translation.

Answer: A more idiomatic and natural way to translate the sentence into English would be:

""It has been discovered that American intelligence agencies were also monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, in addition to other targets.""

This translation better captures the nuances of the original Czech phrase by using more natural-sounding phrasing and vocabulary. The word ""in addition"" is used to convey that this information was discovered separately from the previous revelation about snooping on Merkel's phone, and the phrase ""other targets"" is used to suggest that there may have been multiple individuals or entities being monitored by American intelligence agencies.",0.7567575794,"

  1. His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of ""the army and the people are one hand"" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university...

The phrase is a quote from Mao Zedong, and it emphasizes the idea that the Communist Party and the Chinese people are united as one entity.

But what is wrong with this translation?

Answer: The word order of the original Czech phrase has been reversed in the English translation. In Czech, the phrase is structured as ""armáda a lid jsou jedna ruka"" (the army and people are one hand), while in the English translation, it is structured as ""hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university"" before the phrase ""cries of 'the army and people are one hand'"".

   His arrival was accompanied by cries of ""army and people are one hand"" from the lips of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.

The translation is correct, but it does not fully convey the nuances of the original Czech phrase. Here's a more idiomatic English translation:
   His arrival was met with shouts of ""the army and the people are one hand"" from the crowd of hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.

   His arrival was accompanied by scandalous cries of ""the army and people are one hand"" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.

Is this a good translation? Why or why not?
\end{blockquote}

No, this is not a good translation for several reasons:

1. Loss of nuance: The original Czech phrase ""Jeho příchod byl doprovázen skandováním"" conveys the idea that the arrival was accompanied by shouting or chanting, which is lost in the English translation as simply ""scandalous cries"".
2. Inaccurate word choice: The word ""cry"" does not accurately convey the meaning of the Czech phrase ""skandováním"", which implies a more loud and persistent noise. A better choice would be ""chanting"" or ""shouting"".
3. Incorrect idiomatic expression: The English translation ""the army and people are one hand"" is not an accurate representation of the original Czech phrase, which does not convey any idea of unity between the army and people. Instead, it suggests a more confrontational atmosphere, where people are shouting slog",0.6354083254,"His arrival was accompanied by the cries of ""an army and the people are one hand"" from the lips of thousands of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.

   Analysts are still skeptical about the possibility of the first customer starting to operate the CSeries aircraft within 12 months after its first flight.

The sentence is a translation of the original Czech sentence ""Analytici jsou přesto skeptičtí vůči tomu, že by první zákazník mohl začít provozovat letadlo CSeries 12 měsíců po jeho prvním letu."" and it's a correct translation.

However, I would like to point out that the sentence is quite long and complex, and it might be better to break it down into smaller sentences for easier understanding. Here's an example of how it could be rephrased:

",0.8423192129,"
   ""Analytici remain skeptical about whether the first customer will start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its maiden flight.""

I would like to know what is the source of this sentence, and if it's a real-life situation or just an hypothetical one.

Also, I noticed that ""skeptical"" is used twice in the translation, is there any specific reason for that?

Thank you!",0.9129663717,"
   ""The analytical ones are still skeptical about whether the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its maiden flight.""

However, there is a slight issue with the translation. The word ""skeptical"" does not fully convey the meaning of the original Czech phrase ""skeptičtí"". In Czech, ""skeptičtí"" has a stronger connotation of disbelief or doubt, while ""skeptical"" more implies a cautious or critical attitude.

So, to better capture the nuance of the original phrase in English, a more appropriate translation might be:
   ""The analytical ones are incredulous about whether the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its maiden flight.""

In this revised translation, we've replaced ""skeptical"" with ""incredulous"", which better conveys the sense of disbelief or doubt implied in the original Czech phrase.",0.7960959891,"

   When I return to the past regarding the football club Banik Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly Stadium, everything that happened around it was just a pretext for them to attack me.

The phrase ""když se vrátím do minulosti"" can be translated to English as ""when I return to the past"". The word ""záminka"" is often used in Czech to refer to a false or misleading reason or excuse, and it is being used here to suggest that the events surrounding the purchase of the stadium were not what they seemed.

The sentence structure is also worth noting. In English, we would typically say ""When I return to the past"" followed by the specific event or action, but in Czech, the word order is reversed and the specific event or action comes first, followed by the phrase ""když se vrátím do minulosti"". This can make the sentence sound a bit more dramatic or emphasize the importance of the event.",0.8758777504,"

   ""It is not possible to hold responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a fair trial and without limiting public contributions and expenses during presidential campaigns.""

In this example, the Czech phrase is translated into English with great accuracy, but it may lack some of the nuance or connotation that the original Czech phrase has. This is because certain words or phrases in one language may not have direct translations in another language, and the context and cultural associations of the original phrase may be lost in translation.

For example, the word ""popravu"" in Czech carries a strong connotation of punishment or retribution, which may not be conveyed as clearly in English using the word ""execution."" Similarly, the phrase ""bez řádného soudu"" implies that there was no legal process or due process, which may not be captured by simply saying ""without a fair trial.""

In addition to accuracy, another important aspect of translation is fluency. The translated text should flow smoothly and naturally, without any awkward phrasing or sentences that are difficult to understand.

   ""It is not possible to hold responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process and without limiting public contributions during presidential campaigns.""

But here's where things take a turn. The translator then adds their own opinion about the phrase: ""This is a dangerous precedent that could lead to further erosion of civil liberties and human rights in America.""

2. The phrase ""bez řádného soudu"" means ""without proper due process"", but this is not conveyed clearly in the English translation.

  ",0.674365671,"
   For technical support, I need to complete my registration at the branch.

The translation is perfect! However, there are a few things that could be improved upon in this particular instance. Here's why:

1. The word ""duhý"" can also have a connotation of being silly or foolish, which may not be appropriate in this context. A more neutral term like "" technical issue"" or ""registration problem"" might be better.
2. The phrase ""na to mi"" is a bit informal and colloquial for a formal translation. A more professional way to express the same idea would be ""I need to complete my registration at the branch.""
3. The word ""podpora"" can also mean ""support"", but in this context, it seems that the speaker is referring to technical support specifically. Using the phrase ""technical support"" instead of just ""podpora"" might make the translation more accurate.
4. Finally, the sentence structure could be improved by making it active voice instead of passive voice. For example: ""I need to complete my registration at the branch because there is a technical issue."" This makes the sentence more direct and easier to understand.

Overall,",0.4057053052,"
   ""The technical support wrote me that I have to complete my registration at the branch.""

Here are some possible improvements to make this translation even better:

1. Use of passive voice instead of active voice: Instead of saying ""the technical support wrote me"", it would be more natural in Czech to say ""I was written by the technical support"". This change makes the sentence sound more formal and objective, which is appropriate for a business context.
2. Use of a more precise term than ""branch"": In English, ""branch"" can refer to any part of a company or organization that is separate from the main body. However, in this context, it's clear that the speaker is referring to a physical location where registration needs to be completed. A more precise term would be ""service center"" or ""registration office"".
3. Use of an appropriate preposition: In Czech, the phrase ""na pobočce"" can be translated as ""at the branch"", but it's not clear that this is what the speaker intended. A better translation might be ""to complete my registration at the service center"" or ""to finish my registration at the registration office"".

Here's why:

1145,"Jsem rád, že to nebyl film dokumentární, ale science- fiction.",I am glad it wasn’t a documentary but science fiction.,"
   I am glad it wasn't a documentary but science fiction.

The phrase ""jsem rád"" is an informal way of saying ""I am glad"". The word ""rad"" can be translated as ""glad"", ""happy"" or ""pleased"". In this context, the speaker is expressing relief that the movie was not a documentary but science fiction.

The phrase ""nebyl film dokumentární"" means ""it wasn't a documentary"", and ""science-fiction"" is self-explanatory.",0.892728449,"
   I am glad it was not a documentary but science fiction.

However, there are several issues with this translation that make it less accurate than desired:

1. Word order: In Czech, the word order is different from English. The verb ""jsem"" (I am) comes before the subject ""rad"" (glad), which changes the emphasis of the sentence. To maintain the original meaning and word order in English, it would be more accurate to translate as: I am glad that it was not a documentary but science fiction.
2. Literal translation of ""nebyl"": The phrase ""nebyl"" (was not) is translated literally into English as ""but."" However, the preposition ""but"" has a different connotation than the Czech word ""nebyl,"" which implies a stronger contrast or negation. To maintain the original meaning and nuance, it would be more accurate to translate as: I am glad that it was not a documentary, but science fiction.
3. Genre classification: The phrase ""science-fiction"" is used in English, while the Czech word ""sci-fi"" (short for science fiction) is commonly used in Czech. To maintain consistency",0.7510723286,"
   I am glad it was not a documentary but sci-fi.

The question is why ""but"" is used in this sentence? Is there any specific reason for using ""but""? Or can we simply omit ""but"" and make the translation like this:

I am glad it was not a documentary, sci-fi.

Please provide your expertise on this matter! Thank you so much in advance!
\end{code}

Certainly! The use of ""but"" in the original Czech sentence is important to convey the contrast between two ideas: that the movie was not a documentary and that it was sci-fi. By using ""but,"" the speaker emphasizes this contrast and suggests that these two facts are unexpected or contradictory.

In English, we can express this same contrast by using a conjunction like ""but"" or ""however."" However, in your suggested translation, ""sci-fi"" is not connected to the previous clause at all, which might make it sound disconnected from the rest of the sentence:

I am glad it was not a documentary sci-fi.

   Now he is serving an 8.5-year sentence that was confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.

However, there are a few minor issues with the translation:

1. ""Nyní"" should be translated as ""Now"", not ""Now he"".
2. ""si odpykává trest"" is passive voice, and it would sound more idiomatic in active voice, like ""he is serving his sentence"".
3. The phrase ""pravomocně olomoucký vrchní soud"" can be shortened to just ""Olomouc High Court"", as the word ""pravomocně"" (confirmingly) is implied by the verb ""potvrdil"" (confirmed).

Here's the corrected translation:

Now he is serving an 8.5-year sentence that was confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.",0.8283689326,"

   Now he is serving an 8.5 year sentence that was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.

But what does it really mean? What is the meaning of ""odpykávat trest"" and why is it translated as ""serving a sentence""?

In Czech, ""odpykat"" means to serve out (a punishment or a prison sentence), but it also has other connotations. It can be used in more abstract sense to describe someone who is suffering from some kind of consequences or effects of their actions. For example:

* Odpykávat trest moudrosti - To pay the price for one's foolishness (literally ""to serve out a penalty of wisdom"").
* Odpykat si kárnu násilí - To suffer the consequences of violence (literally ""to serve out a penalty of violence"").

In the original sentence, ""odpykávat trest"" is used to describe someone who has been sentenced to prison and is currently serving their time. However, the word choice also implies that the person is experiencing some kind of negative consequences or effects as a result of their actions, beyond just the physical confin",0.793748468,"Now he is serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc last year.",0.9763852415

   I acknowledge that I have acted wrongly.

The question asks whether ""acknowledge"" is a good choice here, and suggests that perhaps ""realize"" or ""admit"" might be better choices.

I agree with the suggestion. While ""acknowledge"" does convey the idea of recognizing one's mistakes, it can also sound rather formal in some contexts. In this case, ""realize"" or ""admit"" would be more natural and idiomatic ways to express the idea that the speaker has done something wrong.

So, here are three possible translations for the Czech phrase:

2. I admit that I have made a mistake.
3. I acknowledge that I have acted incorrectly.",0.4865381596,"
